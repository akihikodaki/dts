====================
Port Blocklist Tests
====================

Prerequisites
=============

Board with at least 2 DPDK supported NICs attached.

If using vfio the kernel must be >= 3.6+ and VT-d must be enabled in bios.When
using vfio, use the following commands to load the vfio driver and bind it
to the device under test::

   modprobe vfio
   modprobe vfio-pci
   usertools/dpdk-devbind.py --bind=vfio-pci device_bus_id

Test Case: Testpmd with no blocklisted device
=============================================

Run testpmd in interactive mode and ensure that at least 2 ports
are bound and available::

  build/app/dpdk-testpmd -c 3 -- -i

  Initializing port 2... done:  Link Up - speed 10000 Mbps - full-duplex
  Initializing port 3... done:  Link Up - speed 10000 Mbps - full-duplex


Test Case: Testpmd with one port blocklisted
============================================

Select first available port to be blocklisted and specify it with -b option. For the example above::

  build/app/dpdk-testpmd -c 3 -b 0000:01:00.0 -- -i

Check that corresponding device is skipped for binding, and
only 3 ports are available now:::

  EAL: probe driver: 8086:10fb rte_niantic_pmd
  EAL: unbind kernel driver /sys/bus/pci/devices/0000:01:00.1/driver/unbind
  EAL: bind PCI device 0000:01:00.1 to uio driver
  EAL: Device bound

  Initializing port 2... done:  Link Up - speed 10000 Mbps - full-duplex


Test Case: Testpmd with all but one port blocklisted
====================================================

Blocklist all devices except the last one.
For the example above:::

  build/app/dpdk-testpmd -c 3 -b 0000:01:00.0  -b 0000:01:00.0 -b 0000:02:00.0 -- -i

Check that 3 corresponding device is skipped for binding, and
only 1 ports is available now:::

  EAL: probe driver: 8086:10fb rte_niantic_pmd
  EAL: unbind kernel driver /sys/bus/pci/devices/0000:02:00.1/driver/unbind
  EAL: bind PCI device 0000:02:00.1 to uio driver
  EAL: Device bound
  EAL: map PCI resource for device 0000:02:00.1
  EAL: PCI memory mapped at 0x7f22e9aeb000
