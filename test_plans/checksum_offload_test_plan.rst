RX/TX Checksum Offload Tests
============================

The support of RX/TX L3/L4 Checksum offload features by Poll Mode Drivers consists in:

On the RX side:

- Verify IPv4 checksum by hardware for received packets.
- Verify UDP/TCP/SCTP checksum by hardware for received packets.

On the TX side:

- IPv4 checksum insertion by hardware in transmitted packets.
- IPv4/UDP checksum insertion by hardware in transmitted packets.
- IPv4/TCP checksum insertion by hardware in transmitted packets.
- IPv4/SCTP checksum insertion by hardware in transmitted packets (sctp
  length in 4 bytes).
- IPv6/UDP checksum insertion by hardware in transmitted packets.
- IPv6/TCP checksum insertion by hardware in transmitted packets.
- IPv6/SCTP checksum insertion by hardware in transmitted packets (sctp
  length in 4 bytes).

RX side, the L3/L4 checksum offload by hardware can be enabled with the
following command of the ``testpmd`` application::

   enable-rx-cksum

TX side, the insertion of a L3/L4 checksum by hardware can be enabled with the
following command of the ``testpmd`` application and running in a dedicated
tx checksum mode::

   set fwd csum
   tx_checksum set mask port_id

The transmission of packet is done with the ``start`` command of the ``testpmd``
application that will receive packets and then transmit the packet out on all
configured ports. ``mask`` is used to indicated what hardware checksum
offload is required on the ``port_id``. Please check the NIC datasheet for the
corresponding Hardware limits::

      bit 0 - insert ip checksum offload if set
      bit 1 - insert udp checksum offload if set
      bit 2 - insert tcp checksum offload if set
      bit 3 - insert sctp checksum offload if set


Prerequisites
=============

If using vfio the kernel must be >= 3.6+ and VT-d must be enabled in bios.When
using vfio, use the following commands to load the vfio driver and bind it
to the device under test::

   modprobe vfio
   modprobe vfio-pci
   usertools/dpdk-devbind.py --bind=vfio-pci device_bus_id

Assuming that ports ``0`` and ``2`` are connected to a traffic generator,
launch the ``testpmd`` with the following arguments::

  ./build/app/dpdk-testpmd -cffffff -n 1 -- -i --burst=1 --txpt=32 \
  --txht=8 --txwt=0 --txfreet=0 --rxfreet=64 --mbcache=250 --portmask=0x5
  enable-rx-cksum

Set the verbose level to 1 to display information for each received packet::

  testpmd> set verbose 1

Test Case: Validate checksum on the receive packet
==================================================

Setup the ``csum`` forwarding mode::

  testpmd> set fwd csum
  Set csum packet forwarding mode

Start the packet forwarding::

  testpmd> start
    csum packet forwarding - CRC stripping disabled - packets/burst=32
    nb forwarding cores=1 - nb forwarding ports=10
    RX queues=1 - RX desc=128 - RX free threshold=64
    RX threshold registers: pthresh=8 hthresh=8 wthresh=4
    TX queues=1 - TX desc=512 - TX free threshold=0
    TX threshold registers: pthresh=32 hthresh=8 wthresh=8

Configure the traffic generator to send the multiple packets with the following
combination: good/bad ip checksum + good/bad udp/tcp checksum.

Except that SCTP header + payload length must be a multiple of 4 bytes.
IPv4 + UDP/TCP packet length can range from the minimum length to 1518 bytes.

Then verify that how many packets found with Bad-ipcsum or Bad-l4csum::

  testpmd> stop
  ---------------------- Forward statistics for port 0  ----------------------
  RX-packets: 0              RX-dropped: 0             RX-total: 0
  Bad-ipcsum: 0              Bad-l4csum: 0
  TX-packets: 0              TX-dropped: 0             TX-total: 0
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------


Test Case: Insert IPv4/IPv6 UDP/TCP/SCTP checksum on the transmit packet
========================================================================

Setup the ``csum`` forwarding mode::

  testpmd> set fwd csum
  Set csum packet forwarding mode

Enable the IPv4/UDP/TCP/SCTP checksum offload on port 0::

  testpmd> tx_checksum set 0xf 0
  testpmd> start
    csum packet forwarding - CRC stripping disabled - packets/burst=32
    nb forwarding cores=1 - nb forwarding ports=10
    RX queues=1 - RX desc=128 - RX free threshold=64
    RX threshold registers: pthresh=8 hthresh=8 wthresh=4
    TX queues=1 - TX desc=512 - TX free threshold=0
    TX threshold registers: pthresh=32 hthresh=8 wthresh=8

Configure the traffic generator to send the multiple packets for the following
combination: IPv4/UDP, IPv4/TCP, IPv4/SCTP, IPv6/UDP, IPv6/TCP.

Except that SCTP header + payload length must be a multiple of 4 bytes.
IPv4 + UDP/TCP packet length can range from the minimum length to 1518 bytes.

Then verify that the same number of packet are correctly received on the traffic
generator side. And IPv4 checksum, TCP checksum, UDP checksum, SCTP CRC32c need
be validated as pass by the IXIA.

The IPv4 source address will not be changed by testpmd.


Test Case: Do not insert IPv4/IPv6 UDP/TCP checksum on the transmit packet
==========================================================================

Setup the ``csum`` forwarding mode::

  testpmd> set fwd csum
  Set csum packet forwarding mode

Disable the IPv4/UDP/TCP/SCTP checksum offload on port 0::

  testpmd> tx_checksum set 0x0 0
  testpmd> start
    csum packet forwarding - CRC stripping disabled - packets/burst=32
    nb forwarding cores=1 - nb forwarding ports=10
    RX queues=1 - RX desc=128 - RX free threshold=64
    RX threshold registers: pthresh=8 hthresh=8 wthresh=4
    TX queues=1 - TX desc=512 - TX free threshold=0
    TX threshold registers: pthresh=32 hthresh=8 wthresh=8

Configure the traffic generator to send the multiple packets for the following
combination: IPv4/UDP, IPv4/TCP, IPv6/UDP, IPv6/TCP.

IPv4 + UDP/TCP packet length can range from the minimum length to 1518 bytes.

Then verify that the same number of packet are correctly received on the traffic
generator side. And IPv4 checksum, TCP checksum, UDP checksum need
be validated as pass by the IXIA.

The first byte of source IPv4 address will be increment by testpmd. The checksum
is indeed recalculated by software algorithms.


Test Case: Validate RX checksum valid flags on the receive packet
=================================================================

Setup the ``csum`` forwarding mode::

  testpmd> set fwd csum
  Set csum packet forwarding mode

Start the packet forwarding::

  testpmd> start
    csum packet forwarding - CRC stripping disabled - packets/burst=32
    nb forwarding cores=1 - nb forwarding ports=10
    RX queues=1 - RX desc=128 - RX free threshold=64
    RX threshold registers: pthresh=8 hthresh=8 wthresh=4
    TX queues=1 - TX desc=512 - TX free threshold=0
    TX threshold registers: pthresh=32 hthresh=8 wthresh=8

Configure the traffic generator to send the multiple packets with the following
combination: good/bad ip checksum + good/bad udp/tcp checksum.

Check the Rx checksum flags consistent with expected flags.

Test Case: Hardware Checksum Check L4 RX
===========================================
This test involves testing many different scenarios with a L4 checksum.
A variety of tunneling protocols, L3 protocols and L4 protocols are combined
to test as many scenarios as possible. Currently, UDP, TCP and SCTP are used
as L4 protocols, with IP and IPv6 being used at level 3. The tested tunneling
protocols are VXLAN and GRE.

Setup the ``csum`` forwarding mode::

  testpmd> set fwd csum
  Set csum packet forwarding mode

Start the packet forwarding::

  testpmd> start
    csum packet forwarding - CRC stripping disabled - packets/burst=32
    nb forwarding cores=1 - nb forwarding ports=10
    RX queues=1 - RX desc=128 - RX free threshold=64
    RX threshold registers: pthresh=8 hthresh=8 wthresh=4
    TX queues=1 - TX desc=512 - TX free threshold=0
    TX threshold registers: pthresh=32 hthresh=8 wthresh=8

Send a packet with a good checksum::

   port=0, mbuf=0x2269df8780, pkt_len=96, nb_segs=1:
   rx: l2_len=18 ethertype=800 l3_len=20 l4_proto=17 l4_len=8 flags=RTE_MBUF_F_RX_L4_CKSUM_GOOD RTE_MBUF_F_RX_IP_CKSUM_GOOD  RTE_MBUF_F_RX_OUTER_L4_CKSUM_UNKNOWN
   tx: flags=RTE_MBUF_F_TX_L4_NO_CKSUM RTE_MBUF_F_TX_IPV4

Send a packet with a bad checksum::

   port=0, mbuf=0x2269df7e40, pkt_len=96, nb_segs=1:

   tx: flags=RTE_MBUF_F_TX_L4_NO_CKSUM RTE_MBUF_F_TX_IPV4

Verify flags are as expected.

Test Case: Hardware Checksum Check L3 RX
===========================================
This test involves testing L3 checksum hardware offload.
Due to the relative dominance of IPv4 and IPv6 as L3 protocols, and IPv6's
lack of a checksum, only IPv4's checksum is tested.

Setup the ``csum`` forwarding mode::

  testpmd> set fwd csum
  Set csum packet forwarding mode

Start the packet forwarding::

  testpmd> start
    csum packet forwarding - CRC stripping disabled - packets/burst=32

   tx: flags=RTE_MBUF_F_TX_L4_NO_CKSUM RTE_MBUF_F_TX_IPV4

Send a packet with a bad checksum::

   port=0, mbuf=0x2269df7e40, pkt_len=96, nb_segs=1:

   tx: flags=RTE_MBUF_F_TX_L4_NO_CKSUM RTE_MBUF_F_TX_IPV4

Verify flags are as expected.

Test Case: Hardware Checksum Check L4 TX
===========================================
This test involves testing many different scenarios with a L4 checksum.
A variety of tunneling protocols, L3 protocols and L4 protocols are combined
to test as many scenarios as possible. Currently, UDP and TCP are used
as L4 protocols, with IP and IPv6 being used at level 3. The tested tunneling
protocols are VXLAN and GRE. This test is used to determine whether the
hardware offloading of checksums works properly.
