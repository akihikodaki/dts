CVL 1PPS Signal Test Plan
=========================

Description
===========
The E810 supports a total of four single-ended GPIO signals(SPD[20:23])plus one different GPIO signal (CLK_OUT_P/N),
which is configured by default 1PPS(out). The SPD[20:23] is mapping to pin_id[0:3].
This test plan is designed to check the value of related registers, which make up the 1PPS signal.
The registers address depends on some hardware config.
The test cases only give the example of Columbiaville_25g and Columbiaville_100g.


Prerequisites
=============

Topology
--------
DUT port 0 <----> Tester port 0

Hardware
--------
Supported NICs: columbiaville_25g/columbiaville_100g

Software
--------
dpdk: http://dpdk.org/git/dpdk
scapy: http://www.secdev.org/projects/scapy/

General set up
--------------
1. Compile DPDK::

    # CC=gcc meson --werror -Denable_kmods=True -Dlibdir=lib --default-library=static <dpdk build dir>
    # ninja -C <dpdk build dir> -j 110

2. Get the pci device id and interface of DUT and tester.
   For example, 0000:18:00.0 and 0000:18:00.1 is pci device id,
   ens785f0 and ens785f1 is interface::

    <dpdk dir># ./usertools/dpdk-devbind.py -s

    0000:18:00.0 'Device 159b' if=ens785f0 drv=ice unused=vfio-pci
    0000:18:00.1 'Device 159b' if=ens785f1 drv=ice unused=vfio-pci

3. Bind the DUT port to dpdk::

    <dpdk dir># ./usertools/dpdk-devbind.py -b vfio-pci <DUT port pci device id>


Test case
=========

Test case 1: check registers when pin id is 0
---------------------------------------------

this case is designed to check the register value is right when pin id is 0.

test steps
~~~~~~~~~~
1. start testpmd with different pin_id and dump registers::

    <dpdk build dir>/app/dpdk-testpmd <EAL options> -a <DUT port pci device id>,pps_out='[pin:0]' -- -i --rxq=4 --txq=4
    testpmd> read reg 0 0x00088998
    testpmd> read reg 0 0x000889B8
    testpmd> read reg 0 0x00088928
    testpmd> read reg 0 0x00088930
    testpmd> read reg 0 0x000880C8

2. check the GLTSYN_AUX_OUT_0[0] 0x00088998 is 0x00000007 (7), GLTSYN_CLKO_0[0] 0x000889B8 is 0x1DCD6500 (500000000), the 0x00088928 and 0x00088930 is non-zero,
   The 3rd Hexadecimal digit of GLGEN_GPIO_CTL[0] 0x000880C8 is 8. And the 5th binary digit is 1.

Test case 2: check registers when pin id is 1
---------------------------------------------

this case is designed to check the register value is right when pin id is 1.

test steps
~~~~~~~~~~
1. start testpmd with different pin_id and dump registers::

    ./x86_64-native-linuxapp-gcc/app/dpdk-testpmd -c 0xf -n 4 -a 0000:18:00.0,pps_out='[pin:1]' -- -i --rxq=4 --txq=4
    testpmd> read reg 0 0x000889A0
    testpmd> read reg 0 0x000889C0
    testpmd> read reg 0 0x00088938
    testpmd> read reg 0 0x00088940
    testpmd> read reg 0 0x000880CC

2. check the GLTSYN_AUX_OUT_1[0] 0x000889A0 is 0x00000007 (7), GLTSYN_CLKO_1[0] 0x000889C0 is 0x1DCD6500 (500000000), the 0x00088938 and 0x00088940 is non-zero,
   The 3rd Hexadecimal digit of GLGEN_GPIO_CTL[1] 0x000880CC is 9. And the 5th binary digit is 1.

Test case 3: check registers when pin id is 2
---------------------------------------------

this case is designed to check the register value is right when pin id is 2.

test steps
~~~~~~~~~~

    ./x86_64-native-linuxapp-gcc/app/dpdk-testpmd -c 0xf -n 4 -a 0000:18:00.0,pps_out='[pin:2]' -- -i --rxq=4 --txq=4

    testpmd> read reg 0 0x000889C8
    testpmd> read reg 0 0x00088948
