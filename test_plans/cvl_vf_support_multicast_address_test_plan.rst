CVL: VF support multicast address
=================================
VF support adding and removing multicast address


Prerequisites
=============

1. Hardware:
   columbiaville_25g/columbiaville_100g

2. Software:
   DPDK: http://dpdk.org/git/dpdk
   scapy: http://www.secdev.org/projects/scapy/

3. Generate 2 VFs on PF::

    echo 2 > /sys/bus/pci/devices/0000:86:00.0/sriov_numvfs
    ethtool --set-priv-flags enp134s0f0 vf-true-promisc-support on
    ip link set enp134s0f0 vf 0 trust on
    ip link set enp134s0f0 vf 1 trust on

   0000:86:00.0 generate 0000:86:01.0 and 0000:86:01.1
   define 86:01.0 as vf0, 86:01.1 as vf1.
   assign mac address of vf0 is FE:ED:84:92:64:DD,
   assign mac address of vf1 is 5E:8E:8B:4D:89:05.

4. Bind VFs to dpdk driver::

    ./usertools/dpdk-devbind.py -b vfio-pci 86:01.0 86:01.1

5. Launch the app ``testpmd`` with the following arguments::

    ./x86_64-native-linuxapp-gcc/app/dpdk-testpmd -c 0xff -n 6 -- -i --portmask=0x3 --rxq=16 --txq=16
    testpmd> set fwd rxonly
    testpmd> set verbose 1
    testpmd> start
    testpmd> set promisc all off
    testpmd> set allmulti all off

6. show multicast address of port 0 and port 1::

    testpmd> show port 0 mcast_macs
    testpmd> show port 1 mcast_macs

   both of the ports show::

    Number of Multicast MAC address added: 0

Test case 1: one multicast address
==================================
1. send packets::

    sendp([Ether(dst="33:33:00:00:00:01")/IP(src="224.0.0.1")/UDP(sport=22,dport=23)/("X"*480)],iface="enp134s0f1")
    sendp([Ether(dst="33:33:00:40:10:01")/IP(src="224.192.16.1")/UDP(sport=22,dport=23)/("X"*480)],iface="enp134s0f1")

   the pkt1-2 can't be received, pkt3 is received by port 0, pkt4 is received by port 1.

2. configure multicast address::

    mcast_addr add 0 33:33:00:00:00:01

3. show multicast address of port 0 and port 1::

    testpmd> show port 0 mcast_macs
    Number of Multicast MAC address added: 1
      33:33:00:00:00:01
    testpmd> show port 1 mcast_macs
    Number of Multicast MAC address added: 0

4. send same packets, pkt1 can be received by port 0, other packets get same result.

5. remove the multicast address configuration::

    mcast_addr remove 0 33:33:00:00:00:01

6. show multicast address of port 0 and port 1::

    testpmd> show port 0 mcast_macs
    Number of Multicast MAC address added: 0
    testpmd> show port 1 mcast_macs
    Number of Multicast MAC address added: 0

7. send same packets, get same result to step 1.

    sendp([Ether(dst="33:33:00:40:10:01")/Dot1Q(vlan=2)/IP(src="224.192.16.1")/UDP(sport=22,dport=23)/("X"*480)],iface="enp134s0f1")
    sendp([Ether(dst="FE:ED:84:92:64:DD")/IP(src="192.168.0.1")/UDP(sport=22,dport=23)/("X"*480)],iface="enp134s0f1")
    sendp([Ether(dst="5E:8E:8B:4D:89:05")/IP(src="192.168.0.1")/UDP(sport=22,dport=23)/("X"*480)],iface="enp134s0f1")
    sendp([Ether(dst="FE:ED:84:92:64:DE")/IP(src="192.168.0.1")/UDP(sport=22,dport=23)/("X"*480)],iface="enp134s0f1")

   the pkt1-4 can be received by port 0 and port 1, pkt5 is received by port 0, pkt6 is received by port 1.
   pkt7 can't be received by any port.

3. set allmulti off and promisc on::

    set promisc all on
    set allmulti all off

4. send same packets, the pkt1-4 can't be received by port 0 and port 1,
   pkt5-7 can be received by both port 0 and port 1.

Test Case 7: negative case
==========================
1. send packet::

    sendp([Ether(dst="33:33:00:00:00:40")/IP(src="224.0.0.1")/UDP(sport=22,dport=23)/("X"*480)],iface="enp134s0f1")

   check the packet cannot be received by port 0.

2. add a multicast address::

    testpmd> mcast_addr add 0 33:33:00:00:00:40

3. send the packet again, check the packet can be received by port 0.

4. add a same multicast address::

    testpmd> mcast_addr add 0 33:33:00:00:00:40
    multicast address already filtered by port

5. send the packet again, check the packet can be received by port 0.

6. remove nonexistent multicast address::

    testpmd> mcast_addr remove 0 33:33:00:00:00:41
    multicast address not filtered by port 0

7. send the packet again, check the packet can be received by port 0.

8. add wrong multicast address::

    testpmd> mcast_addr add 0 32:33:00:00:00:41
    Invalid multicast addr 32:33:00:00:00:41

9. send the packet again, check the packet can be received by port 0.

10.remove the multicast address::

    mcast_addr remove 0 33:33:00:00:00:40

11.send the packet again, check the packet cannot be received by port 0.

Test Case 8: set vlan filter on
===============================
1. send multicast packets with/without vlan ID::

    sendp([Ether(dst="33:33:00:00:00:01")/IP(src="224.0.0.1")/UDP(sport=22,dport=23)/("X"*480)],iface="enp134s0f1")
    sendp([Ether(dst="33:33:00:00:00:01")/Dot1Q(vlan=1)/IP(src="224.0.0.1")/UDP(sport=22,dport=23)/("X"*480)],iface="enp134s0f1")
    sendp([Ether(dst="33:33:00:40:10:01")/IP(src="224.192.16.1")/UDP(sport=22,dport=23)/("X"*480)],iface="enp134s0f1")
    sendp([Ether(dst="33:33:00:40:10:01")/Dot1Q(vlan=1)/IP(src="224.192.16.1")/UDP(sport=22,dport=23)/("X"*480)],iface="enp134s0f1")

   the pkt1-4 can't be received by any port.

2. configure multicast address::

    mcast_addr add 0 33:33:00:00:00:01

3. show multicast address of port 0 and port 1::

    testpmd> show port 0 mcast_macs
    Number of Multicast MAC address added: 1
      33:33:00:00:00:01
    testpmd> show port 1 mcast_macs
    Number of Multicast MAC address added: 0

4. send same packets, pkt1 can be received by port 0, other packets get same result.

5. set vlan filter on::

    vlan set filter on 0
    rx_vlan add 1 0

   send same packets, pkt1-2 can be received by port 0, other packets can't be received by any port.

6. remove the vlan filter::

    rx_vlan rm 1 0

   send same packets, pkt1 can be received by port 0, other packets can't be received by any port.

7. remove the multicast address configuration::

    mcast_addr remove 0 33:33:00:00:00:01

8. show multicast address of port 0 and port 1::

    testpmd> show port 0 mcast_macs
    Number of Multicast MAC address added: 0
    testpmd> show port 1 mcast_macs
    Number of Multicast MAC address added: 0

9. send same packets, the pkt1-4 can't be received by any port.
