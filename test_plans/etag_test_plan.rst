External Tag (E-tag) Tests
==========================

In some systems an additional external tag (E-tag) can be present before the
VLAN. NIC X550 support VLANs in presence of external tags.
E-tag mode is used for systems where the device adds a tag to identify a
subsystem (usually a VM) and the near end switch adds a tag indicating the
destination subsystem.

The support of E-tag features by X550 consists in:
- The filtering of received E-tag packets
- E-tag header stripping by VF device in received packets
- E-tag header insertion by VF device in transmitted packets
- E-tag forwarding to assigned VF by E-tag id

Prerequisites
=============

1. Create 2VF devices from PF device::

      ./dpdk_nic_bind.py --st
      0000:84:00.0 'Device 1563' drv=igb_uio unused=
      echo 2 > /sys/bus/pci/devices/0000\:84\:00.0/max_vfs

2. Detach VFs from the host, bind them to pci-stub driver::

      /sbin/modprobe pci-stub

    using `lspci -nn|grep -i ethernet` got VF device id, for example "8086 1565"::

       echo "8086 1565" > /sys/bus/pci/drivers/pci-stub/new_id
       echo 0000:84:10.0 > /sys/bus/pci/devices/0000:84:10.0/driver/unbind
       echo 0000:84:10.0 > /sys/bus/pci/drivers/pci-stub/bind
       echo 0000:84:10.2 > /sys/bus/pci/devices/0000:84:10.2/driver/unbind
       echo 0000:84:10.2 > /sys/bus/pci/drivers/pci-stub/bind

3. Passthrough VF 84:10.0 & 84:10.2 to vm0 and start vm0::

      /usr/bin/qemu-system-x86_64  -name vm0 -enable-kvm \
      -cpu host -smp 4 -m 2048 -drive file=/home/image/sriov-fc20-1.img -vnc :1 \
      -device pci-assign,host=84:10.0,id=pt_0 \
      -device pci-assign,host=84:10.2,id=pt_1

4. Login vm0 and them bind VF devices to igb_uio driver::

      ./tools/dpdk_nic_bind.py --bind=igb_uio 00:04.0 00:05.0

5. Start host testpmd, set it in rxonly mode and enable verbose output::

      testpmd -c f -n 3 -- -i
      testpmd> set fwd rxonly
      testpmd> set verbose 1
      testpmd> start

6. Start guest testpmd, set it in mac forward mode::

      testpmd -c 0x3 -n 1  -- -i  --tx-offloads=0x8fff
      testpmd> set fwd mac
      testpmd> start

Test Case 1: L2 tunnel filter
=============================

Enable E-tag l2 tunnel support means enabling ability of parsing E-tag packet.
This ability should be enabled before we enable filtering, forwarding,
offloading for this specific type of tunnel::

    testpmd> port config 0 l2-tunnel E-tag enable

Send 802.1BR packet to PF and VFs, check packet normally received.

 - type=0x893f - length=150 - nb_segs=1 - (outer) L2 type: Unknown
 - (outer) L3 type: IPV4 - (outer) L4 type: UDP

Test Case 2: E-tag filter
=========================

Enable E-tag packet forwarding and add E-tag on VF0, Send 802.1BR packet with
broadcast mac and check packet only received on VF0::

    testpmd> E-tag set forwarding on port 0
    testpmd> E-tag set filter add e-tag-id 1000 dst-pool 0 port 0

Same E-tag forwarding to VF1, Send 802.1BR packet with broadcast mac and
check packet only received on VF1::

    testpmd> E-tag set filter add e-tag-id 1000 dst-pool 1 port 0

Same E-tag forwarding to PF0, Send 802.1BR packet with broadcast mac and
check packet only received on PF::

    testpmd> E-tag set filter add e-tag-id 1000 dst-pool 2 port 0

Remove E-tag, Send 802.1BR packet with broadcast mac and check packet not
received::

    testpmd> E-tag set filter del e-tag-id 1000 port 0

Test Case 3: E-tag insertion
============================

Enable E-tag insertion in VF0, send normal packet to VF1 and check forwarded
packet contain E-tag::

    testpmd> E-tag set insertion on port-tag-id 1000 port 0 vf 0

Test Case 4: E-tag strip
========================

Enable E-tag strip on PF, Send 802.1BR packet to VF and check forwarded packet
without E-tag::

    testpmd> E-tag set stripping on port 0

Disable E-tag strip on PF, Send 802.1BR packet and check forwarded packet with
E-tag::

    testpmd> E-tag set stripping off port 0
