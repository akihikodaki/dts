DPDK Hotplug API Tests
======================

This test for Hotplug API feature can be run on linux userspace. It
will check if NIC port can be attached and detached without exiting the
application process. Furthermore, it will check if it can reconfigure
new configurations for a port after the port is stopped, and if it is
able to restart with those new configurations. It is based on testpmd
application.

The test is performed by running the testpmd application and using a
traffic generator. Port configurations can be set interactively,
and still be set at the command line when launching the application in
order to be compatible with previous test framework.

Prerequisites
=============

Assume DPDK managed at least one device for physical or none for virtual.
This feature only supports igb_uio now, for uio_pci_generic is
on the way, will test it after enabled.

To run the testpmd application in linuxapp environment with 4 lcores,
4 channels with other default parameters in interactive mode::

        $ ./dpdk-testpmd -c 0xf -n 4 -- -i

Test ENV:

* All test cases can be run in 32bit and 64bit platform.

* OS support: Fedora, Ubuntu, RHEL, SUSE, but freebsd will not be
  included as hotplug has no plan to support that platform

* All kernel version(from 2.6) can be support, for vfio need kernel
  version greater than 3.6.

* Virtualization support: KVM/VMware/Xen, container is in the roadmap

Test Case 1: port detach & attach for physical devices with igb_uio
===================================================================

1. Start testpmd::

      $ ./dpdk-testpmd -c 0xf -n 4 -- -i

2. Bind new physical port to igb_uio(assume BDF 0000:02:00.0)::

      # ./tools/dpdk_nic_bind -b igb_uio 0000:02:00.0

3. Attach port 0::

      run "port attach 0000:02:00.0"

      run "port start 0"

      run "show port info 0", check port 0 info display.

4. Check package forwarding when startup::

      run "start", then "show port stats 0" check forwarding packages start.

      run "port detach 0", check the error message of port not stopped.

      run "stop", then "show port stats 0", check forwarding packages stopped.

5. Detach port 0 after port closed::

      run "port stop 0"

      run "port close 0".

      run "port detach 0", check port detached successful.

6. Re-attach port 0(assume BDF 0000:02:00.0)::

      run "port attach 0000:02:00.0",

      run "port start 0".

      run "show port info 0", check port 0 info display.

7. Check package forwarding after re-attach::

      run "start", then "show port stats 0" check forwarding packages start.

      run "port detach 0", check the error message of port not stopped.

      run "stop", then "show port stats 0", check forwarding packages stopped.


Test Case 2: port detach and attach for physical devices with vfio
==================================================================

1. Start testpmd::

      $ ./dpdk-testpmd -c 0xf -n 4 -- -i

2. Bind new physical port to igb_uio(assume BDF 0000:02:00.0)::

      # ./tools/dpdk_nic_bind -b vfio-pci 0000:02:00.0

3. Attach port 0(assume BDF 0000:02:00.0)::

      run "port attach 0000:02:00.0"

      run "port start 0"

      run "show port info 0", check port 0 info display.

4. Detach port 0 after port closed::

      run "port stop 0", then "show port stats 0", check port stopped.

      run "port close 0".

      run "port detach 0", check detach status(should fail as no detach
                         support at the moment for vfio).

      run "port close 0".

      run "port detach 0", check port detached successful.

6. Re-attach port 0(assume BDF is 0000:02:00.0)::

      run "port attach 0000:02:00.0",

      run "port start 0".

      run "show port info 0", check port 0 info display.
