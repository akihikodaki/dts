SPI: Security Parameters Index

The SPI is an arbitrary 32-bit value that is used by a receiver to identify
the SA to which an incoming packet is bound.

Sequence Number:

This unsigned 32-bit field contains a counter value that increases by
one for each packet sent

AES: Advanced Encryption Standard

GCM: Galois Counter Mode

Prerequisites
=============
2 *  10Gb Ethernet ports of the DUT are directly connected in full-duplex to
different ports of the peer traffic generator.

Bind two ports to vfio-pci.
modprobe vfio-pci
