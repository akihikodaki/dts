IP Pipeline Application Tests
=============================

Description
===========
The "examples/ip_pipeline" application is the main DPDK Packet Framework
application.

Prerequisites
==============
The DUT must have four 10G Ethernet ports connected to four ports on
Tester that are controlled by the Scapy packet generator::

    dut_port_0 <---> tester_port_0
    dut_port_1 <---> tester_port_1
    dut_port_2 <---> tester_port_2
    dut_port_3 <---> tester_port_3

Assume four DUT 10G Ethernet ports' pci device id is as the following::

    dut_port_0 : "0000:05:00.0"
    dut_port_1 : "0000:05:00.1"
    dut_port_2 : "0000:05:00.2"
    dut_port_3 : "0000:05:00.3"

Bind them to dpdk igb_uio driver::

    ./usertools/dpdk-devbind.py -b igb_uio 05:00.0 05:00.1 05:00.2 05:00.3

Notes:
>>> if using trex as packet generator::

    trex>
    portattr --prom on -a
    service --port 1                                                                  1
    capture monitor start --rx 1 -v

The crypto cases need an IXIA as packet generator::

    dut_port_0 <---> IXIA_port_0

Change pci device id of LINK0 to pci device id of dut_port_0.
There are two drivers supported now: aesni_gcm and aesni_mb.
Different drivers support different Algorithms.

Build dpdk and examples=ip_pipeline:
   CC=gcc meson -Denable_kmods=True -Dlibdir=lib  --default-library=static <build_target>

    cryptodev CRYPTO0 dev crypto_aesni_gcm0 queue 1 1024

3. Use AEAD algorithm aes-gcm to encrypt and decrypt payload
   with specified aead_key, aead_iv, aead_aad and digest_size::

    pipeline PIPELINE0 table 0 rule add match hash ipv4_addr 100.0.0.10 action fwd port 0 sym_crypto encrypt type aead aead_algo aes-gcm aead_key 000102030405060708090a0b0c0d0e0f aead_iv 000102030405060708090a0b aead_aad 000102030405060708090a0b0c0d0e0f digest_size 8 data_offset 290

    pipeline PIPELINE0 table 0 rule add match hash ipv4_addr 100.0.0.10 action fwd port 0 sym_crypto decrypt type aead aead_algo aes-gcm aead_key 000102030405060708090a0b0c0d0e0f aead_iv 000102030405060708090a0b aead_aad 000102030405060708090a0b0c0d0e0f digest_size 8 data_offset 290

   AEAD_KEY: 16 BYTES, AEAD_IV: 12 BYTES, AAD: MAXIMUM 16 BYTES, DIGEST 8/12/16 bytes,
   You may find all supported key/aad/iv info in
   dpdk/drivers/crypto/aesni_gcm/aesni_gcm_pmd_ops.c aesni_gcm_pmd_capabilities

4. Run ip_pipeline app as the following::

    ./<build_target>/examples/dpdk-ip_pipeline -a 0000:81:00.0 --vdev crypto_aesni_gcm0
    --socket-mem 0,2048 -l 23,24,25 -- -s ./examples/ip_pipeline/examples/flow_crypto.cli

5. Send packets with IXIA port,
   Use a tool to caculate the ciphertext from plaintext and key as an expected value.
   Then compare the received ciphertext through the ip_pipeline to the expected value to see whether consistent.

   For instance, send a packet with ixia, set the frame size to 70 bytes, which is 32-byte data ipv4 pkts.
   You may add longer length, but the received packets length = ROUND_UP_MULTIPLE_TIMES_OF_16(x(size of pkt) – 38) + DIGEST_SIZE
   Track the packets of IXIA, expect receiving a packet with 78 bytes long,
   with the 32-byte payload matching encryption result of the tool, and 8 bytes digest matching the tool-computed tag.

   Set the input packet to 78 bytes in decrypt procedure,
   including the 32-byte ciphertext and 8-byte authentication tag.
   The output data is plaintext consistent with the input data of encrypt procedure.

5. Send packets with IXIA port,
   Use a tool to caculate the ciphertext from plaintext and key as an expected value.
   Compare the received ciphertext through the ip_pipeline to the expected value to see whether consistent.

   For instance, send a packet with ixia, set the frame size to 70 bytes, which is 32-byte data ipv4 pkts.
   You may add longer length, but the received packets length = ROUND_UP_MULTIPLE_TIMES_OF_16(x(size of pkt) – 38)

3. Then use cipher_auth algorithm aes-cbc and SHA1_HMAC to encrypt and decrypt payload
   with specified cipher_key, cipher_iv, auth_key and digest_size::

    pipeline PIPELINE0 table 0 rule add match hash ipv4_addr 100.0.0.10 action fwd port 0 sym_crypto encrypt type cipher_auth cipher_algo aes-cbc cipher_key 000102030405060708090a0b0c0d0e0f cipher_iv 000102030405060708090a0b0c0d0e0f auth_algo sha1-hmac auth_key 000102030405060708090a0b0c0d0e0f digest_size 12 data_offset 290

   Use a tool to caculate the ciphertext from plaintext and cipher key with AES-CBC algorithm.
   Then caculate the 12-byte digest tag from ciphertext plus IP header (52 bytes)and auth_key with SHA1-HMAC algorithm.
   Compare the received ciphertext through the ip_pipeline to the expected value to see whether consistent,
   and compare the 12-byte digest tag with the tool-computed tag.

   For instance, send a packet with ixia, set the frame size to 70 bytes, which is 32-byte data ipv4 pkts.
   You may add longer length, but the received packets length = ROUND_UP_MULTIPLE_TIMES_OF_16(x(size of pkt) – 38) + DIGEST_SIZE
   Track the packets of IXIA, expect receiving a packet with 82 bytes long,
   with the 32-byte payload matching encryption result of the tool, and 12 bytes digest matching the tool-computed tag.
