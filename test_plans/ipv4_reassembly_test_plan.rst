IP Reassembly Tests
===================

This document provides a test plan for benchmarking of the IP Reassembly
sample application. This is a simple example app featuring packet processing
using Intel® Data Plane Development Kit (Intel® DPDK) that show-cases the use
of IP fragmented packets reassembly.


Prerequisites
=============

If using vfio the kernel must be >= 3.6+ and VT-d must be enabled in bios.When
using vfio, use the following commands to load the vfio driver and bind it
to the device under test::

   modprobe vfio
   modprobe vfio-pci
   usertools/dpdk-devbind.py --bind=vfio-pci device_bus_id

1x Intel® 82599 (Niantic) NICs (1x 10GbE full duplex optical ports per NIC)
plugged into the available PCIe Gen2 8-lane slots.

Build dpdk and examples=ip_reassembly:
   CC=gcc meson -Denable_kmods=True -Dlibdir=lib  --default-library=static <build_target>
   ninja -C <build_target>

   meson configure -Dexamples=ip_reassembly <build_target>
   ninja -C <build_target>

Test Case: Send 1K packets, 4 fragments each and 1K maxflows
============================================================

Sample command::

  ./<build_target>/examples/dpdk-ip_reassembly -c 0x2 -n 4 -- \
      -P -p 0x2 --config "(1,0,1)" --maxflows=1024 --flowttl=10s

Sends 1K packets split in 4 fragments each with a ``maxflows`` of 1K.

It expects:

  - 4K IP packets to be sent to the DUT.
  - 1K TCP packets being forwarded back to the TESTER.
  - 1K packets with a valid TCP checksum.


Test Case: Send 2K packets, 4 fragments each and 1K maxflows
============================================================

Sample command::

  ./<build_target>/examples/dpdk-ip_reassembly -c 0x2 -n 4 -- \
      -P -p 0x2 --config "(1,0,1)" --maxflows=1024 --flowttl=10s

Sends 2K packets split in 4 fragments each with a ``maxflows`` of 1K.

It expects:

  - 8K IP packets to be sent to the DUT.
  - 1K TCP packets being forwarded back to the TESTER.
  - 1K packets with a valid TCP checksum.


Test Case: Send 4K packets, 7 fragments each and 4K maxflows
============================================================

Sample command::

  ./<build_target>/examples/dpdk-ip_reassembly -c 0x2 -n 4 -- \
      -P -p 0x2 --config "(1,0,1)" --maxflows=4096 --flowttl=10s

Modifies the sample app source code to enable up to 7 fragments per packet,
and it need set the "CONFIG_RTE_LIBRTE_IP_FRAG_MAX_FRAG=7" in ./config/common_base and re-build DPDK.

Sends 4K packets split in 7 fragments each with a ``maxflows`` of 4K.

It expects:

  - 28K IP packets to be sent to the DUT.
  - 4K TCP packets being forwarded back to the TESTER.
  - 4K packets with a valid TCP checksum.


Test Case: Send +1K packets and ttl 3s; wait +ttl; send 1K packets
==================================================================

Sample command::

  ./<build_target>/examples/dpdk-ip_reassembly -c 0x2 -n 4 -- \
      -P -p 0x2 --config "(1,0,1)" --maxflows=1024 --flowttl=3s

Sends 1100 packets split in 4 fragments each.

It expects:

  - 4400 IP packets to be sent to the DUT.
  - 1K TCP packets being forwarded back to the TESTER.
  - 1K packets with a valid TCP checksum.


Then waits until the ``flowttl`` timeout and sends 1K packets.

It expects:

  - 4K IP packets to be sent to the DUT.
  - 1K TCP packets being forwarded back to the TESTER.
  - 1K packets with a valid TCP checksum.


Test Case: Send more packets than maxflows; only maxflows packets are forwarded back
====================================================================================

Sample command::

  ./<build_target>/examples/dpdk-ip_reassembly -c 0x2 -n 4 -- \
      -P -p 0x2 --config "(1,0,1)" --maxflows=1023 --flowttl=5s

Sends 1K packets with ``maxflows`` equal to 1023.

It expects:

  - 4092 IP packets to be sent to the DUT.
  - 1023 TCP packets being forwarded back to the TESTER.
  - 1023 packets with a valid TCP checksum.

Then sends 1023 packets.

It expects:

  - 4092 IP packets to be sent to the DUT.
  - 1023 TCP packets being forwarded back to the TESTER.
  - 1023 packets with a valid TCP checksum.

Finally waits until the ``flowttl`` timeout and re-send 1K packets.

It expects:

  - 4092 IP packets to be sent to the DUT.
  - 1023 TCP packets being forwarded back to the TESTER.
  - 1023 packets with a valid TCP checksum.


Test Case: Send more fragments than supported
=============================================

Sample command::

  ./<build_target>/examples/dpdk-ip_reassembly -c 0x2 -n 4 -- \
      -P -p 0x2 --config "(1,0,1)" --maxflows=1024 --flowttl=10s

Sends 1 packet split in 5 fragments while the maximum number of supported
fragments per packet is 4.

It expects:

  - 5 IP packets to be sent to the DUT.
  - 0 TCP packets being forwarded back to the TESTER.
  - 0 packets with a valid TCP checksum.



Test Case: Send 3 frames and delay the 4th; no frames are forwarded back
========================================================================

Sample command::

  ./<build_target>/examples/dpdk-ip_reassembly -c 0x2 -n 4 -- \
      -P -p 0x2 --config "(1,0,1)" --maxflows=1024 --flowttl=3s

Creates 1 packet split in 4 fragments. Sends the first 3 fragments and waits
until the ``flowttl`` timeout. Then sends the 4th fragment.

It expects:

  - 4 IP packets to be sent to the DUT.
  - 0 TCP packets being forwarded back to the TESTER.
  - 0 packets with a valid TCP checksum.



Test Case: Send jumbo frames
============================

Sample command::

  ./<build_target>/examples/dpdk-ip_reassembly -c 0x2 -n 4 -- \
      -P -p 0x2 --config "(1,0,1)" --maxflows=1024 --flowttl=10s --enable-jumbo --max-pkt-len=9500

Sets the NIC MTU to 9000 and sends 1K packets of 8900B split in 4 fragments of
2500B at the most. The reassembled packet size will not be bigger than the
MTU previously defined.

It expects:

  - 4K IP packets to be sent to the DUT.
  - 1K TCP packets being forwarded back to the TESTER.
  - 1K packets with a valid TCP checksum.


Test Case: Send jumbo frames without enable them in the app
===========================================================

Sample command::

  ./<build_target>/examples/dpdk-ip_reassembly -c 0x2 -n 4 -- \
      -P -p 0x2 --config "(1,0,1)" --maxflows=1024 --flowttl=10s

Sends jumbo packets in the same way the previous test case does but without
enabling support within the sample app.

It expects:

  - 4K IP packets to be sent to the DUT.
  - 0 TCP packets being forwarded back to the TESTER.
  - 0 packets with a valid TCP checksum.
