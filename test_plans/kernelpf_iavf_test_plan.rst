Kernel PF + IAVF test plan
==========================

Intel Adaptive Virtual Function(IAVF) is aimed to provide a common VF for VM
which means just need one unified VF driver so you don't have to reload
different VF driver when you upgrade the PF NIC.
One of the advantages is you don't have to do any modification for code or
hardware for an existing VM image running on the new NIC.

Requirement
===========
This plan for IAVF only supports kernel PF scenario.

Hardware
========
ICE driver NIC.

Prerequisites
=============
Get the pci device id of DUT, for example::

    ./usertools/dpdk-devbind.py -s

    0000:18:00.0 'Device 1592' if=enp24s0f0 drv=ice unused=igb_uio
    0000:18:00.1 'Device 1592' if=enp24s0f1 drv=ice unused=igb_uio

Create 1 VF from 1 kernel PF::

    echo 1 > /sys/bus/pci/devices/0000\:18\:00.0/sriov_numvfs

Set VF mac as 00:01:23:45:67:89::

    ip link set $PF_INTF vf 0 mac 00:01:23:45:67:89

Test IAVF cases on host or in qemu

Bind VF device to igb_uio or vfio-pci

Start up VF port::

    ./<build_target>/app/dpdk-testpmd -c f -n 4 -- -i

Test case: VF basic RX/TX
=========================
Set rxonly forward, start testpmd

Send 100 random packets from tester, check packets can be received

Set txonly forward, start testpmd

Check tester could receive the packets from application generated


Test case: VF MAC filter
========================
Disable promisc mode, add a new MAC to VF0 and then start testpmd::

    testpmd> set promisc all off
    testpmd> mac_addr add 0 00:11:22:33:44:55
    testpmd> set fwd mac
    testpmd> start

Use scapy to send 100 random packets with current VF0's MAC, verify the
packets can be received and forwarded by the VF::

    p=Ether(dst="00:01:23:45:67:89")/IP()/Raw(load='X'*30)

Use scapy to send 100 random packets with new added VF0's MAC, verify the
packets can be received and forwarded by the VF::

    p=Ether(dst="00:11:22:33:44:55")/IP()/Raw(load='X'*30)

Use scapy to send 100 random packets with a wrong MAC to VF0, verify the
packets can't be received by the VF.

Remove the MAC 00:11:22:33:44:55::

    testpmd> mac_addr remove 0 00:11:22:33:44:55

Use scapy to send 100 random packets with removed VF0's MAC, verify the
packets can't be received and forwarded by the VF::

    p=Ether(dst="00:11:22:33:44:55")/IP()/Raw(load='X'*30)

Set the default mac address to other mac, check the mac address has be changed
to new set mac::

    testpmd> mac_addr set 0 00:01:23:45:67:11
    testpmd> show port info 0

Use scapy to send 100 random packets with original VF0's MAC, verify the
packets can't be received and forwarded by the VF::

    p=Ether(dst="00:01:23:45:67:89")/IP()/Raw(load='X'*30)

Use scapy to send 100 random packets with new set VF0's MAC, verify the
packets can be received and forwarded by the VF::

    p=Ether(dst="00:01:23:45:67:11")/IP()/Raw(load='X'*30)

Reset to original mac address

Note::
    Not set VF MAC from kernel PF for this case, if set, will print
    "not permitted error" when add new MAC for VF.

Test case: VF promisc
=====================
Enable kernel trust mode::

    ip link set $PF_INTF vf 0 trust on

    echo 1 > /sys/bus/pci/devices/0000\:18\:00.1/sriov_numvfs

Bind VFs to vfio-pci::

    ./usertools/dpdk-devbind.py -b vfio-pci 18:01.0 18:11.0

Start l3fwd power with one queue per port::

    ./examples/l3fwd-power/build/l3fwd-power -l 6,7 -n 4 -- \
    -p 0x3 --config '(0,0,6),(1,0,7)'

Send one packet to VF0 and VF1, check that thread on core6 and core7 waked up::

    L3FWD_POWER: lcore 6 is waked up from rx interrupt on port 0 queue 0
    L3FWD_POWER: lcore 7 is waked up from rx interrupt on port 0 queue 0

Check the packet has been normally forwarded.

    L3FWD_POWER: lcore 6 sleeps until interrupt triggers
    L3FWD_POWER: lcore 7 sleeps until interrupt triggers

Send packet flows to VF0 and VF1, check that thread on core6 and core7 will
keep up awake.
