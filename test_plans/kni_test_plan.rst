Kernel NIC Interface (KNI) Tests
================================

Description
===========

This document provides the plan for testing the Kernel NIC Interface
application with support of rte_kni kernel module.
Kernel NIC Interface is a DPDK alternative solution to the existing linux
tun-tap interface for the exception path. Kernel NIC Interface allows the
standard Linux net tools(ethtool/ifconfig/tcpdump) to facilitate managing the
DPDK port. At the same time, it add an interface with the kernel net stack.
The test supports Multi-Thread KNI.

All kni model parameter detail info on user guides:http://dpdk.org/doc/guides/sample_app_ug/kernel_nic_interface.html

The ``rte_kni`` kernel module can be installed by a ``lo_mode`` parameter.

loopback disabled::

    insmod rte_kni.ko
    insmod rte_kni.ko "lo_mode=lo_mode_none"
    insmod rte_kni.ko "lo_mode=unsupported string"

loopback mode=lo_mode_ring enabled::

    insmod rte_kni.ko "lo_mode=lo_mode_ring"

loopback mode=lo_mode_ring_skb enabled::

    insmod rte_kni.ko "lo_mode=lo_mode_ring_skb"

The ``rte_kni`` kernel module can also be installed by a ``kthread_mode``
parameter. This parameter is ``single`` by default.

kthread single::

    insmod rte_kni.ko
    insmod rte_kni.ko "kthread_mode=single"

kthread multiple::

    insmod rte_kni.ko
    insmod rte_kni.ko "kthread_mode=multiple"


The ``kni`` application is run with EAL parameters and parameters for the
application itself. For details about the EAL parameters, see the relevant
DPDK **Getting Started Guide**. This application supports two parameters for
itself.

- ``--config="(port id, rx lcore, tx lcore, kthread lcore, kthread lcore, ...)"``:
  Port and cores selection. Kernel threads are ignored if ``kthread_mode``
  is not ``multiple``.

ports cores::

    e.g.:

        --config="(0,1,2),(1,3,4)"              No kernel thread specified.
        --config="(0,1,2,21),(1,3,4,23)"        One kernel thread in use.
        --config="(0,1,2,21,22),(1,3,4,23,25)   Two kernel threads in use.

- ``-P``: Promiscuous mode. This is off by default.

Prerequisites
=============

If using vfio the kernel must be >= 3.6+ and VT-d must be enabled in bios.When
using vfio, use the following commands to load the vfio driver and bind it
to the device under test::

   modprobe vfio
   modprobe vfio-pci
   usertools/dpdk-devbind.py --bind=vfio-pci device_bus_id

The DUT has at least 2 DPDK supported IXGBE NIC ports.

The DUT has to be able to install rte_kni kernel module and launch kni
application with a default configuration (This configuration may change form a
system to another)::

    rmmod rte_kni
    rmmod igb_uio
    insmod ./x86_64-default-linuxapp-gcc/kmod/igb_uio.ko
    insmod ./x86_64-default-linuxapp-gcc/kmod/rte_kni.ko
    ./<build_target>/examples/dpdk-kni -c 0xa0001e -n 4 -- -P -p 0x3 --config="(0,1,2,21),(1,3,4,23)" &

Case config::

   For enable KNI features, need to set the "CONFIG_RTE_KNI_KMOD=y" in ./config/common_base and re-build DPDK.

Test Case: ifconfig testing
===========================

Launch the KNI application. Assume that ``port 2 and 3`` are used to this
application. Cores 1 and 2 are used to read from NIC, cores 2 and 4 are used
to write to NIC, threads 21 and 23 are used by the kernel.

As the kernel module is installed using ``"kthread_mode=single"`` the core
affinity is set using ``taskset``::

    ./<build_target>/examples/dpdk-kni -c 0xa0001e -n 4 -- -P -p 0xc --config="(2,1,2,21),(3,3,4,23)"


Verify whether the interface has been added::

    ifconfig -a


If the application is launched successfully, it will add two interfaces in
kernel net stack named ``vEth2_0``, ``vEth3_0``.

Interface name start with ``vEth`` followed by the port number and an
additional incremental number depending on the number of kernel threads::

    vEth2_0: flags=4098<BROADCAST,MULTICAST>  mtu 1500
            ether 00:00:00:00:00:00  txqueuelen 1000  (Ethernet)
            RX packets 14  bytes 2098 (2.0 KiB)
            RX errors 0  dropped 10  overruns 0  frame 0
            TX packets 0  bytes 0 (0.0 B)
            TX errors 0  dropped 0 overruns 0  carrier 0  collisions 0

    vEth3_0: flags=4098<BROADCAST,MULTICAST>  mtu 1500
            ether 00:00:00:00:00:00  txqueuelen 1000  (Ethernet)
            RX packets 13  bytes 1756 (1.7 KiB)
            RX errors 0  dropped 10  overruns 0  frame 0
            TX packets 0  bytes 0 (0.0 B)
            TX errors 0  dropped 0 overruns 0  carrier 0  collisions 0



Verify whether ifconfig can set Kernel NIC Interface up::

    ifconfig vEth2_0 up

Now ``vEth2_0`` is up and has IPv6 address::

    vEth2_0: flags=4163<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST>  mtu 1500
            inet6 fe80::92e2:baff:fe37:92f8  prefixlen 64  scopeid 0x20<link>
            ether 90:e2:ba:37:92:f8  txqueuelen 1000  (Ethernet)
            RX packets 30  bytes 4611 (4.5 KiB)
            RX errors 0  dropped 21  overruns 0  frame 0
            TX packets 6  bytes 468 (468.0 B)
            TX errors 0  dropped 0 overruns 0  carrier 0  collisions 0


Verify whether ifconfig can add an ipv6 address::

    ifconfig vEth2_0 add fe80::1

``vEth2_0`` has added ipv6 address::

    29: vEth2_0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qlen 1000
        inet6 fe80::1/128 scope link
           valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
        inet6 fe80::92e2:baff:fe37:92f8/64 scope link
           valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever


Delete the IPv6 address::

    ifconfig vEth2_0 del fe80::1

The port deletes it::

    29: vEth2_0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qlen 1000
        inet6 fe80::92e2:baff:fe37:92f8/64 scope link
           valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever

Set MTU parameter::

    ifconfig vEth2_0 mtu 1300

``vEth2_0`` changes the mtu parameter::

    29: vEth2_0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1300 qdisc pfifo_fast state UNKNOWN mode DEFAULT qlen 1000
    link/ether 90:e2:ba:37:92:f8 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff

Verify whether ifconfig can set ip address::

    ifconfig vEth2_0 192.168.2.1 netmask 255.255.255.192
    ip -family inet address show dev vEth2_0

``vEth2_0`` has IP address and netmask now::

    29: vEth2_0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1300 qdisc pfifo_fast state UNKNOWN qlen 1000
        inet 192.168.2.1/26 brd 192.168.2.63 scope global vEth2_0

Verify whether ifconfig can set ``vEth2_0`` down::

    ifconfig vEth2_0 down
    ifconfig vEth2_0

``vEth2_0`` is down and no ipv6 address::

    vEth2_0: flags=4098<BROADCAST,MULTICAST>  mtu 1300
            inet 192.168.2.1  netmask 255.255.255.192  broadcast 192.168.2.63
            ether 90:e2:ba:37:92:f8  txqueuelen 1000  (Ethernet)
            RX packets 70  bytes 12373 (12.0 KiB)
            RX errors 0  dropped 43  overruns 0  frame 0
            TX packets 25  bytes 4132 (4.0 KiB)
            TX errors 0  dropped 0 overruns 0  carrier 0  collisions 0


Repeat all the steps for interface ``vEth3_0``

Test Case: Ping and Ping6 testing
=================================

If the application is launched successfully, it will add two interfaces in
kernel net stack named ``vEth2_0``, ``vEth3_0``.

Assume the link status of ``vEth2_0`` is up and set ip address is ``192.168.2.1``
and ``vEth3_0`` is up and set ip address is ``192.168.3.1``. Verify the
command ping::

    ping -w 1 -I vEth2_0 192.168.2.1

it can receive all packets and no packet loss::

    PING 192.168.2.1 (192.168.2.1) from 192.168.2.1 vEth2_0: 56(84) bytes of data.
    64 bytes from 192.168.2.1: icmp_req=1 ttl=64 time=0.040 ms

    --- 192.168.2.1 ping statistics ---
    1 packets transmitted, 1 received, 0% packet loss, time 0ms
    rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 0.040/0.040/0.040/0.000 ms

Assume ``port A`` on tester is linked with ``port 2`` on DUT. Verify the
command ping from tester::

    ping -w 1 -I "port A" 192.168.2.1

it can receive all packets and no packet loss.

Verify a wrong address::

    ping -w 1 -I vEth2_0 192.168.0.123

no packets is received::

    PING 192.168.0.123 (192.168.0.123) from 192.168.0.1 vEth2_0: 56(84) bytes of data.

    --- 192.168.0.123 ping statistics ---
    1 packets transmitted, 0 received, 100% packet loss, time 0ms

Verify the command ping6::

    ping6 -w 1 -I vEth2_0 "Eth2_0's ipv6 address"

it can receive all packets and no packet loss::

    PING fe80::92e2:baff:fe08:d6f0(fe80::92e2:baff:fe08:d6f0) from fe80::92e2:baff:fe08:d6f0 vEth2_0: 56 data bytes
    64 bytes from fe80::92e2:baff:fe08:d6f0: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.070 ms

    --- fe80::92e2:baff:fe08:d6f0 ping statistics ---
    1 packets transmitted, 1 received, 0% packet loss, time 0ms
    rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 0.070/0.070/0.070/0.000 ms

Verify the command ping6 from tester::

    ping6 -w 1 -I "port A" "Eth2_0's ipv6 address"

it can receive all packets and no packet loss.

Verify a wrong ipv6 address::

    ping6 -w 1 -I vEth2_0 "random ipv6 address"

no packets is received::

    PING fe80::92e2:baff:fe08:d6f1(fe80::92e2:baff:fe08:d6f1) from fe80::92e2:baff:fe08:d6f0 vEth2_0: 56 data bytes

    --- fe80::92e2:baff:fe08:d6f1 ping statistics ---
    1 packets transmitted, 0 received, 100% packet loss, time 0ms

Repeat all the steps for interface ``vEth3_0``

Test Case: Tcpdump testing
==========================

Assume ``port A and B`` on packet generator connects to NIC ``port 2 and 3``.
Trigger the packet generator of bursting packets from ``port A and B`, then
check if tcpdump can capture all packets. The packets should include
``tcp`` packets, ``udp`` packets, ``icmp`` packets, ``ip`` packets,
``ether+vlan tag+ip`` packets, ``ether`` packets.

Verify whether tcpdump can capture packets::

    tcpdump -i vEth2_0
    tcpdump -i vEth3_0


Test Case: Ethtool testing
==========================

In this time, KNI can only support ethtool commands which is to get information.
So all below commands are to show information commands.

Verify whether ethtool can show Kernel NIC Interface's standard information::

    ethtool vEth2_0

Verify whether ethtool can show Kernel NIC Interface's driver information::

    ethtool -i vEth2_0

Verify whether ethtool can show Kernel NIC Interface's statistics::

    ethtool -S vEth2_0

Verify whether ethtool can show Kernel NIC Interface's pause parameters::

    ethtool -a vEth2_0

Verify whether ethtool can show Kernel NIC Interface's offload parameters::

    ethtool -k vEth2_0

Verify whether ethtool can show Kernel NIC Interface's RX/TX ring parameters::

    ethtool -g vEth2_0

Verify whether ethtool can show Kernel NIC Interface's Coalesce parameters.
It is not currently supported::

    ethtool -c vEth2_0

Verify whether ethtool can show Kernel NIC Interface's MAC registers::

    ethtool -d vEth2_0

Verify whether ethtool can show Kernel NIC Interface's EEPROM dump::

    ethtool -e vEth2_0

Repeat all the steps for interface ``vEth3_0``

Test Case: Packets statistics testing
=====================================

Install the kernel module with loopback parameter ``lo_mode=lo_mode_ring_skb``
and launch the KNI application.

Assume that ``port 2 and 3`` are used by this application::

    rmmod kni
    insmod ./kmod/rte_kni.ko "lo_mode=lo_mode_ring_skb"
    ./<build_target>/examples/dpdk-kni -c 0xff -n 3 -- -p 0xf -i 0xf -o 0xf0

Assume ``port A and B`` on tester connects to NIC ``port 2 and 3``.

Get the RX packets count and TX packets count::

    ifconfig vEth2_0

Send 5 packets from tester. And check whether both RX and TX packets of
``vEth2_0`` have increased 5.

Repeat for interface ``vEth3_0``

Test Case: Stress testing
=========================

Insert the rte_kni kernel module 50 times while changing the parameters.
Iterate through lo_mode and kthread_mode values sequentially, include wrong
values. After each insertion check whether kni application can be launched
successfully.

Insert the kernel module 50 times while changing randomly the parameters.
Iterate through lo_mode and kthread_mode values randomly, include wrong
values. After each insertion check whether kni application can be launched
successfully::

        rmmod rte_kni
        insmod ./kmod/rte_kni.ko <Changing Parameters>
         ./<build_target>/examples/dpdk-kni -c 0xa0001e -n 4 -- -P -p 0xc --config="(2,1,2,21),(3,3,4,23)"


Using ``dmesg`` to check whether kernel module is loaded with the specified
parameters. Some permutations, those with wrong values, must fail to
success. For permutations with valid parameter values, verify the application can be
successfully launched and then close the application using CTRL+C.

Test Case: loopback mode performance testing
============================================

Compare performance results for loopback mode using:

    - lo_mode: lo_mode_fifo and lo_mode_fifo_skb.
    - kthread_mode: single and multiple.
