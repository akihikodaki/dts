===============================
L3 Forwarding Exact Match Tests
===============================

The Layer-3 Forwarding results are produced using ``l3fwd`` application.

Prerequisites
=============

1. Hardware requirements:

    - For each CPU socket, each memory channel should be populated with at least 1x DIMM
    - Board is populated with 4x 1GbE or 10GbE ports. Special PCIe restrictions may
      be required for performance. For example, the following requirements should be
      met for Intel 82599 (Niantic) NICs:

        - NICs are plugged into PCIe Gen2 or Gen3 slots
        - For PCIe Gen2 slots, the number of lanes should be 8x or higher
        - A single port from each NIC should be used, so for 4x ports, 4x NICs should
          be used

    - NIC ports connected to traffic generator. It is assumed that the NIC ports
      P0, P1, P2, P3 (as identified by the DPDK application) are connected to the
      traffic generator ports TG0, TG1, TG2, TG3. The application-side port mask of
      NIC ports P0, P1, P2, P3 is noted as PORTMASK in this section.

2. BIOS requirements:

    - Intel Hyper-Threading Technology is ENABLED
    - Hardware Prefetcher is DISABLED
    - Adjacent Cache Line Prefetch is DISABLED
    - Direct Cache Access is DISABLED

3. Linux kernel requirements:

    - Linux kernel has the following features enabled: huge page support, UIO, HPET
    - Appropriate number of huge pages are reserved at kernel boot time
    - The IDs of the hardware threads (logical cores) per each CPU socket can be
      determined by parsing the file /proc/cpuinfo. The naming convention for the
      logical cores is: C{x.y.z} = hyper-thread z of physical core y of CPU socket x,
      with typical values of x = 0 .. 3, y = 0 .. 7, z = 0 .. 1. Logical cores
      C{0.0.1} and C{0.0.1} should be avoided while executing the test, as they are
      used by the Linux kernel for running regular processes.

4. Software application requirements

5. If using vfio the kernel must be >= 3.6+ and VT-d must be enabled in bios.When
   using vfio, use the following commands to load the vfio driver and bind it
   to the device under test::

      modprobe vfio
      modprobe vfio-pci
      usertools/dpdk-devbind.py --bind=vfio-pci device_bus_id

- In hash mode, the hash table used for packet routing is:

|

+-------+-------------+-----------+-------------+-----------+-----------+--------+
|   #   | IPv4        | IPv4      | Port        | Port      | L4        | Output |
|       | destination | source    | destination | source    | protocol  | port   |
|       | address     | address   |             |           |           |        |

+-------+-------------+-----------+-------------+-----------+-----------+--------+


6. Traffic generator requirements

The flows need to be configured and started by the traffic generator:

|

+------+---------+----------+-----------+------+-------+--------+----------------------------------+
| Flow | Traffic | IPv4     | IPv4      | Port | Port  | L4     | IPv4                             |
|      | Gen.    | Dst.     | Src.      | Dst. | Src.  | Proto. | Dst Addr                         |
|      | Port    | Address  | Address   |      |       |        | Mask(Continuous Increment Host)  |
+------+---------+----------+-----------+------+-------+--------+----------------------------------+
|   1  |   TG0   | 201.0.0.0| 200.20.0.1|  102 |  12   |   TCP  |    255.240.0.0                   |
+------+---------+----------+-----------+------+-------+--------+----------------------------------+
|   2  |   TG1   | 101.0.0.0| 100.10.0.1|  101 |  11   |   TCP  |    255.240.0.0                   |
+------+---------+------------+---------+------+-------+--------+----------------------------------+

The queue column represents the expected NIC port RX queue where the packet
should be written by the NIC hardware when RSS is enabled for that port.

Test Case: Layer-3 Forwarding (in Hash Mode)
============================================

The following items are configured through the command line interface of the
application:

  - The set of one or several RX queues to be enabled for each NIC port
  - The set of logical cores to execute the packet forwarding task
  - Mapping of the NIC RX queues to logical cores handling them.
  - The set of hash-entry-num for the exact match

The test report should provide the throughput rate measurements (in mpps
and % of the line rate for 4x NIC ports) as listed in the table below:

|

+----+---------+---------+-------------+---------+----------+------------------+
| #  |Number of|Total    |Number       |Total    |Number    | Throughput Rate  |

+----+---------+---------+-------------+---------+----------+--------+---------+


The application command line associated with each of the above tests is
presented in the table below. The test report should present this table with
the actual command line used, replacing the PORTMASK and C{x.y.z} with their
actual values used during test execution.
