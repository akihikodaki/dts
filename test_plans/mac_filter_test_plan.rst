==================
Whitelisting Tests
==================

If using vfio the kernel must be >= 3.6+ and VT-d must be enabled in bios.When
using vfio, use the following commands to load the vfio driver and bind it
to the device under test::

   modprobe vfio
   modprobe vfio-pci
   usertools/dpdk-devbind.py --bind=vfio-pci device_bus_id

Prerequisites
=============

Assuming that at least a port is connected to a traffic generator,
launch the ``testpmd`` with the following arguments::

  ./x86_64-default-linuxapp-gcc/build/app/test-pmd/testpmd -c 0xc3 -n 3 -- -i \
  --burst=1 --rxpt=0     --rxht=0 --rxwt=0 --txpt=36 --txht=0 --txwt=0 \
  --txfreet=32 --rxfreet=64 --mbcache=250 --portmask=0x3

The -n command is used to select the number of memory channels. It should match the number of memory channels on that setup.

Set the verbose level to 1 to display information for each received packet::

  testpmd> set verbose 1

Show port infos for port 0 and store the default MAC address and the maximum
number of MAC addresses::

  testpmd> show port info 0

    ********************* Infos for port 0  *********************
    MAC address: 00:1B:21:4D:D2:24
    Link status: up
    Link speed: 10000 Mbps
    Link duplex: full-duplex
    Promiscuous mode: enabled
    Allmulticast mode: disabled
    Maximum number of MAC addresses: 127


Test Case: add/remove mac addresses
===================================

Initialize first port without ``promiscuous mode``::

  testpmd> set promisc 0 off

Read the stats for port 0 before sending the packet::

  testpmd> show port stats 8

    ######################## NIC statistics for port 8  ########################
    RX-packets: 0          RX-errors: 0         RX-bytes: 64
    TX-packets: 0          TX-errors: 0         TX-bytes: 0
    ############################################################################

Send a packet with default destination MAC address for port 0::

  testpmd> show port stats 0

    ######################## NIC statistics for port 8  ########################
    RX-packets: 1          RX-errors: 0         RX-bytes: 128
    TX-packets: 0          TX-errors: 0         TX-bytes: 0
    ############################################################################

Verify that the packet was received (RX-packets incremented).

Send a packet with destination MAC address different than the port 0 address,
let's call it A.::

  testpmd> show port stats 0

    ######################## NIC statistics for port 8  ########################
    RX-packets: 1          RX-errors: 0         RX-bytes: 128
    TX-packets: 0          TX-errors: 0         TX-bytes: 0
    ############################################################################

Verify that the packet was not received (RX-packets not incremented).

Add the MAC address A to the port 0::

  testpmd> mac_addr add 0 <A>
  testpmd> show port stats 0


    ######################## NIC statistics for port 8  ########################
    RX-packets: 2          RX-errors: 0         RX-bytes: 192
    TX-packets: 0          TX-errors: 0         TX-bytes: 0
    ############################################################################

Verify that the packet was received (RX-packets incremented).

Remove the MAC address A to the port 0::

  testpmd> mac_addr remove 0 <A>
  testpmd> show port stats 0


    ######################## NIC statistics for port 8  ########################
    RX-packets: 2          RX-errors: 0         RX-bytes: 192
    TX-packets: 0          TX-errors: 0         TX-bytes: 0
    ############################################################################

Verify that the packet was not received (RX-packets not incremented).


Test Case: invalid addresses test
=================================

Add a MAC address of all zeroes to the port 0::

  testpmd> mac_addr add 0 00:00:00:00:00:00

Verify that the response is "Invalid argument" (-EINVAL)

Remove the default MAC address::

  testpmd> mac_addr remove 0 <default MAC address>

Verify that the response is "Address already in use" (-EADDRINUSE)

Add two times the same address::

  testpmd> mac_addr add 0 <A>
  testpmd> mac_addr add 0 <A>

Verify that there is no error

Add as many different addresses as maximum MAC addresses (n)::

   testpmd> mac_addr add 0 <A>
   ... n-times
   testpmd> mac_addr add 0 <A+n>

Add one more different address::

   testpmd> mac_addr add 0 <A+n+1>

Verify that the response is "No space left on device" (-ENOSPC)
