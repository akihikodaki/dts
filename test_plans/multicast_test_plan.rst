==============
IPv4 Multicast
==============

This is the test plan for the Intel® DPDK IPv4 Multicast application. The results are
produced using the ``ipv4_fragmentation`` application.

Description
-----------

The test application (``ipv4_multicast``) implements a basic Layer-3 forwarding scheme on
the traffic received from two network interfaces. For each input packet, the
output interface the packet should be sent out on is determined based on a lookup
operation into the routing table maintained by the application.

This application disregards the rules for multicast groups assigned by IANA (RFC 5771) and
only sets a goal to demonstrate a sample multicast implementation.

The ``ipv4_multicast`` application accepts the following command line options:

- For the EAL:

  - ``-c COREMASK``: Hexadecimal bitmask of cores we are running on
  - ``-m MB``: Memory to allocate (default 64MB)
  - ``-n NUM``: Number of memory channels (don't detect)
  - ``-r NUM``: Number of memory ranks (don't detect)

- And for the application itself (seperated by ``--`` from above options):

  - ``-p PORTMASK``: Hexadecimal bitmask of ports to use
  - ``-q NUM``: Number of queues per lcore


Prerequisites
=============

1. Hardware requirements:

- Board is populated with 2x 10GbE ports. Special PCIe restrictions may
  be required for performance. For example, the following requirements should be
  met for Intel 82599 (Niantic) NICs:

	- NICs are plugged into PCIe Gen2 or Gen3 slots
	- For PCIe Gen2 slots, the number of lanes should be 8x or higher
	- A single port from each NIC should be used, so for 4x ports, 4x NICs should
	  be used

- NIC ports connected to traffic generator. It is assumed that the NIC ports
  P0 and P2 (as identified by the DPDK application) are connected to the
  traffic generator ports TG0 and TG2. The application-side port mask of
  NIC ports is noted as PORTMASK in this section.

2. BIOS requirements:

- Intel® Hyper-Threading Technology is ENABLED
- Hardware Prefetcher is DISABLED
- Adjacent Cache Line Prefetch is DISABLED
- Direct Cache Access is DISABLED

3. Linux kernel requirements:

- Linux kernel has the following features enabled: huge page support, UIO, HPET
- Appropriate number of huge pages are reserved at kernel boot time
- The IDs of the hardware threads (logical cores) per each CPU socket can be
  determined by parsing the file /proc/cpuinfo. The naming convention for the
  logical cores is: C{x.y.z} = hyper-thread z of physical core y of CPU socket x,
  with typical values of x = 0 .. 3, y = 0 .. 7, z = 0 .. 1. Logical cores
  C{0.0.0} and C{0.0.1} should be avoided while executing the test, as they are
  used by the Linux kernel for running regular processes. NUMA mode is not supported
  by the application, so both cores and NICs should be on one socket for best results.

4. Software application requirements

The routing table consists of 15 entries, each of them consisting of two fields -
multicast address (which corresponds to multicast group, as per IPv4 Multicast
specification) and a portmask associated with that group. The routing table is
implemented as a hash table.

The routing table looks like this:

|

+-------+-------------+----------+
| Entry | IPv4        | Output   |
| #     | destination | ports    |
|       | address     |          |
+-------+-------------+----------+
| 0     | 224.0.0.1   | P1       |
+-------+-------------+----------+
| 1     | 224.0.0.2   | P2       |
+-------+-------------+----------+
| 2     | 224.0.0.3   | P1 P2    |
+-------+-------------+----------+
| 3     | 224.0.0.4   | P3       |
+-------+-------------+----------+
| 4     | 224.0.0.5   | P1 P3    |
+-------+-------------+----------+
| 5     | 224.0.0.6   | P2 P3    |
+-------+-------------+----------+
| 6     | 224.0.0.7   | P1 P2 P3 |
+-------+-------------+----------+
| 7     | 224.0.0.8   | P4       |
+-------+-------------+----------+
| 8     | 224.0.0.9   | P1 P4    |
+-------+-------------+----------+
| 9     | 224.0.0.10  | P2 P4    |
+-------+-------------+----------+
| 10    | 224.0.0.11  | P1 P2 P4 |
+-------+-------------+----------+
| 11    | 224.0.0.12  | P3 P4    |
+-------+-------------+----------+
| 12    | 224.0.0.13  | P1 P3 P4 |
+-------+-------------+----------+
| 13    | 224.0.0.14  | P2 P3 P4 |
+-------+-------------+----------+
| 14    | 224.0.0.15  | P1-P4    |
+-------+-------------+----------+

|

The routing table is given for reference and information purposes.

For convenience purposes, the portmask for every multicast group is equal to number of
group i.e. for multicast group 5 (IP address 224.0.0.5) the portmask is equal to 5. This
allows for some flexibility in testing environment like support for different numbers of
ports and different port configurations (up to four ports are supported).

The recommended setup is to set up three flows per input port. Each input port should be
located on a different NIC (such as P0 and P2). Then, a multicast group should be set
corresponding to the setup i.e. if ports 0 and 2 are connected to the traffic generator,
multicast group 5 must be used.

Each of the three flows should be set up to be returned through the same port, through the
opposite port, and through both ports. Appropriate destination IP addresses should be set
up to indicate from which port the packet must return.

5. Traffic generator requirements

The flows need to be configured and started by the traffic generator (this table assumes that
P0 and P2 are used on testing machine):

|

+------+---------+------------+-----------+------+-------+--------+
| Flow | Traffic | IPv4       | IPv4      | Port | Port  | L4     |
|      | Gen.    | Src.       | Dst.      | Src. | Dest. | Proto. |
|      | Port    | Address    | Address   |      |       |        |
+------+---------+------------+-----------+------+-------+--------+
| F1   | TG0     | 10.100.0.1 | 224.0.0.1 | ANY  | ANY   | ANY    |
+------+---------+------------+-----------+------+-------+--------+
| F2   | TG0     | 10.100.0.2 | 224.0.0.4 | ANY  | ANY   | ANY    |
+------+---------+------------+-----------+------+-------+--------+
| F3   | TG0     | 10.100.0.3 | 224.0.0.5 | ANY  | ANY   | ANY    |
+------+---------+------------+-----------+------+-------+--------+
| F4   | TG1     | 11.100.0.1 | 224.0.0.4 | ANY  | ANY   | ANY    |
+------+---------+------------+-----------+------+-------+--------+
| F5   | TG1     | 11.100.0.2 | 224.0.0.1 | ANY  | ANY   | ANY    |
+------+---------+------------+-----------+------+-------+--------+
| F6   | TG1     | 11.100.0.3 | 224.0.0.5 | ANY  | ANY   | ANY    |
+------+---------+------------+-----------+------+-------+--------+

|

These flows do not change across the test cases.

6.Compile examples/ipv4_multicast::

    meson configure -Dexamples=ipv4_multicast x86_64-native-linuxapp-gcc
    ninja -C x86_64-native-linuxapp-gcc

Test Case: IP4 Multicast Forwarding
===================================

In addition to performance testing, multicast packets produced by application must be validated
with the following criteria:

  - Source and destination IPv4 addresses of the packets forwarded by the application
    must not be changed during forwarding
  - Ethernet address of forwarded packets must be set to IPv4 multicast Ethernet addresses, which
    are constructed from 01-00-5E-00-00-00 ORed with lower 23 bits of 28-bit multicast group.
  - Payload of the packets must not change in any way
  - Packets should arrive only from ports they are supposed to arrive.

Here is a table which shows the requirements for which TG flows should arrive from which port:

|

+------+---------+-----------+------------+-----------+
| Flow | Traffic | RECV Port | IPv4       | IPv4      |
|      | Gen.    |           | Src.       | Dst.      |
|      | Port    |           | Address    | Address   |
+------+---------+-----------+------------+-----------+
| F1   | TG0     | TG0       | 10.100.0.1 | 224.0.0.1 |
+------+---------+-----------+------------+-----------+
| F2   | TG0     | TG1       | 10.100.0.2 | 224.0.0.4 |
+------+---------+-----------+------------+-----------+
| F3   | TG0     | TG0 TG1   | 10.100.0.3 | 224.0.0.5 |
+------+---------+-----------+------------+-----------+
| F4   | TG1     | TG1       | 11.100.0.1 | 224.0.0.4 |
+------+---------+-----------+------------+-----------+
| F5   | TG1     | TG0       | 11.100.0.2 | 224.0.0.1 |
+------+---------+-----------+------------+-----------+
| F6   | TG1     | TG0 TG1   | 11.100.0.3 | 224.0.0.5 |
+------+---------+-----------+------------+-----------+

|

Assuming that ports ``0`` and ``2`` are connected to a traffic generator,
launch the ``ipv4_multicast`` with the following arguments::

  ./examples/ipv4_multicast/build/ipv4_multicast -c 0x2 -n 1 -- -p 0x5 -q 2

If the app run successfully, it will be the same as the shown in the terminal. ::

  ...
  Initializing port 0 on lcore 1...  Address:90:E2:BA:4A:53:28, rxq=0 txq=1,0 done:
  Skipping disabled port 1
  Initializing port 2 on lcore 1...  Address:90:E2:BA:50:8D:68, rxq=0 txq=1,0 done:
  Skipping disabled port 3

  Checking link statusdone
  Port0 Link Up. Speed 10000 Mbps - full-duplex
  Port2 Link Up. Speed 10000 Mbps - full-duplex

Test Case: IPv4 Multicast Performance
=====================================

The following items are configured through the command line interface of the
application:

  - The maximum number of RX queues (ports) to be available for each lcore
  - The set of ports to be enabled for forwarding

The test report should provide the throughput rate measurements (in mpps
and % of the line rate for 2x NIC ports) as listed in the table below:

The application command line associated with each of the above tests is
presented in the table below. The test report should present this table with
the actual command line used, replacing the PORTMASK  with its actual value
used during test execution.
