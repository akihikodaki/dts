packet capture
==============

Packet capture framework feature support packet capturing on dpdk ethernet
devices. DPDK provides dpdk-pdump tool under app/pdump directory for packet
capturing on dpdk.

The dpdk-pdump application will act as the secondary process. The EAL thread
polls for packet capture fd. If fd polled matches packet capture fd, it will
initiate packet capture processing.

The testpmd application will act as the primary process. The primary process
create socket for packet capture connection with the secondary process and
registers socket with packet capture epoll event. Packet capture event will
be polled as part of interrupt thread.

The primary process creates mempool and two rte_rings for packets duplication
and sharing packet info with the secondary process respectively.

Upon receiving packet capture event, the primary process receive either
register RX/TX callbacks or remove RX/TX callbacks message from the secondary
process on socket.If packet matches, reference count of packet will be
incremented and enqueued to second rte_ring for the secondary process to use.

Test configuration
==================

2x NICs (2 full duplex ports per NIC) plugged into the available slots on a
platform, another two nic ports are linked with cables.

Connections ports between TESTER and DUT::

       TESTER                                DUT
                    physical link
     .--------.                          .--------.
     | portA0 | <----------------------> | portB0 |
     |        |                          |        |
     | portA1 | <----------------------> | portB1 |
     '--------'                          |        |
                                 ------> | portB2 |
                                |        |        |
                                 ------> | portB3 |
                                         '--------'

note: portB0/portB1 are the binded ports.
      portB2/portB3 keep link up status and don't bind to dpdk driver.
      Except portB0/portB1, DUT should have other two ports on link up status

Prerequisites
=============

Enable pcap lib in dpdk code and recompile::

Test cases
==========

The testpmd application act as server process with port-topology chained mode,
the dpdk-pdump act as client process to dump capture packet with different
options setting. Select one port of tester as tx port, another port of tester
as rx port, send different type packets from two ports, check pcap file
content dumped by scapy and tcpdump to confirm testpmd working correctly,
check pcap file content dumped by tcpdump and dpdk-pdump to confirm
dpdk-pdump working correctly.

#. Bind two port on DUT::

#. On dut, use port 0 as rx/tx port. If dut port 0 rx dump is set, scapy send
   packet from tester port 0 and tcpdump dumps tester port 1's packet. If dut
   port 0 tx dump is set, scapy send packet from tester port 1 and tcpdump dumps
   tester port 0's packet.

   haven't been binded to dpdk and have been in linked status
