Link Bonding for mode 4 (802.3ad)
=================================

This test plan is mainly to test link bonding mode 4(802.3ad) function via
testpmd.

link bonding mode 4 is IEEE 802.3ad Dynamic link aggregation. Creates
aggregation groups that share the same speed and duplex settings. Utilizes all
slaves in the active aggregator according to the 802.3ad specification. DPDK
realize it based on 802.1AX specification, it includes LACP protocol and Marker
protocol. This mode requires a switch that supports IEEE 802.3ad Dynamic link
aggregation.

note: Slave selection for outgoing traffic is done according to the transmit
hash policy, which may be changed from the default simple XOR layer2 policy.

Requirements
============
#. Bonded ports shall maintain statistics similar to normal port.

#. The slave links shall be monitor for link status change. See also the concept
   of up/down time delay to handle situations such as a switch reboots, it is
   possible that its ports report "link up" status before they become usable.

#. Upon unbonding the bonding PMD driver must restore the MAC addresses that the
   slaves had before they were enslaved.

#. According to the bond type, when the bond interface is placed in promiscuous
   mode it will propagate the setting to the slave devices.

#. LACP control packet filtering offload. It is a idea of performance
   improvement, which use hardware offloads to improve packet classification.

#. support three 802.3ad aggregation selection logic modes (stable/bandwidth/
   count). The Selection Logic selects a compatible Aggregator for a port, using
   the port LAG ID. The Selection Logic may determine that the link should be
   operated as a standby link if there are constraints on the simultaneous
   attachment of ports that have selected the same Aggregator.
