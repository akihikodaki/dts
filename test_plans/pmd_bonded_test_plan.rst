Bonding Tests
=============

Provide the ability to support Link Bonding for 1GbE and 10GbE ports similar the ability found in Linux to allow the aggregation of multiple (slave) NICs into a single logical interface between a server and a switch. A new PMD will then process these interfaces based on the mode of operation specified and supported. This provides support for redundant links, fault tolerance and/or load balancing of networks. Bonding may also be used in connection with 802.1q VLAN support.
The following is a good overview http://www.cyberciti.biz/howto/question/static/linux-ethernet-bonding-driver-howto.php

Requirements
============

* The Bonding mode SHOULD be specified via an API for a logical bonded interface used for link aggregation.
* A new PMD layer SHALL operate on the bonded interfaces and may be used in connection with 802.1q VLAN support.
* Bonded ports SHALL maintain statistics similar to that of normal ports
* The slave links SHALL be monitor for link status change. See also the concept of up/down time delay to handle situations such as a switch reboots, it is possible that its ports report "link up" status before they become usable.
* The following bonding modes SHALL be available;

  - Mode = 0 (balance-rr) Round-robin policy: (default). Transmit packets in sequential order from the first available network interface (NIC) slave through the last. This mode provides load balancing and fault tolerance. Packets may be bulk dequeued from devices then serviced in round-robin manner. The order should be specified so that it corresponds to the other side.

  - Mode = 1 (active-backup) Active-backup policy: Only one NIC slave in the bond is active. A different slave becomes active if, and only if, the active slave fails. The single logical bonded interface's MAC address is externally visible on only one NIC (port) to avoid confusing the network switch. This mode provides fault tolerance. Active-backup policy is useful for implementing high availability solutions using two hubs

  - Mode = 2 (balance-xor) XOR policy: Transmit network packets based on the default transmit policy. The default policy (layer2) is a simple [(source MAC address XOR'd with destination MAC address) modulo slave count].  Alternate transmit policies may be selected. The default transmit policy selects the same NIC slave for each destination MAC address. This mode provides load balancing and fault tolerance.

  - Mode = 3 (broadcast) Broadcast policy: Transmit network packets on all slave network interfaces. This mode provides fault tolerance but is only suitable for special cases.

  - Mode = 4 (802.3ad) IEEE 802.3ad Dynamic link aggregation. Creates aggregation groups that share the same speed and duplex settings. Utilizes all slaves in the active aggregator according to the 802.3ad specification. This mode requires a switch that supports IEEE 802.3ad Dynamic link aggregation. Slave selection for outgoing traffic is done according to the transmit hash policy, which may be changed from the default simple XOR layer2 policy.

  - Mode = 5 (balance-tlb) Adaptive transmit load balancing. Linux bonding driver mode that does not require any special network switch support. The outgoing network packet traffic is distributed according to the current load (computed relative to the speed) on each network interface slave. Incoming traffic is received by one currently designated slave network interface. If this receiving slave fails, another slave takes over the MAC address of the failed receiving slave.

  - Mode = 6 (balance-alb) Adaptive load balancing. Includes balance-tlb plus receive load balancing (rlb) for IPV4 traffic, and does not require any special network switch support. The receive load balancing is achieved by ARP negotiation. The bonding driver intercepts the ARP Replies sent by the local system on their way out and overwrites the source hardware address with the unique hardware address of one of the NIC slaves in the single logical bonded interface such that different network-peers use different MAC addresses for their network packet traffic.
* The available transmit policies SHALL be as follows;

  - layer2: Uses XOR of hardware MAC addresses to generate the hash.  The formula is (source MAC XOR destination MAC) modulo slave count. This algorithm will place all traffic to a particular network peer on the same slave. This algorithm is 802.3ad compliant.
  - layer3+4: This policy uses upper layer protocol information, when available, to generate the hash.  This allows for traffic to a particular network peer to span multiple slaves, although a single connection will not span multiple slaves.   The formula for unfragmented TCP and UDP packets is ((source port XOR dest port) XOR  ((source IP XOR dest IP) AND 0xffff)  modulo slave count.  For fragmented TCP or UDP packets and all other IP protocol traffic, the source and destination port information is omitted.  For non-IP traffic, the formula is the same as for the layer2 transmit hash policy. This policy is intended to mimic the behavior of certain switches, notably Cisco switches with PFC2 as well as some Foundry and IBM products. This algorithm is not fully 802.3ad compliant.  A single TCP or UDP conversation containing both fragmented and unfragmented packets will see packets striped across two interfaces.  This may result in out of order delivery.  Most traffic types will not meet these criteria, as TCP rarely fragments traffic, and most UDP traffic is not involved in extended conversations.  Other implementations of 802.3ad may or may not tolerate this noncompliance.

* Upon unbonding the bonding PMD driver MUST restore the MAC addresses that the slaves had before they were enslaved.
* According to the bond type, when the bond interface is placed in promiscuous mode it will propagate the setting to the slave devices as follow: For mode=0, 2, 3 and 4 the promiscuous mode setting is propagated to all slaves.
* Mode=0, 2, 3 generally require that the switch have the appropriate ports grouped together (e.g. Cisco 5500 series with EtherChannel support or may be called a trunk group).

* Goals:

  - Provide a forwarding example that demonstrates Link Bonding for 2/4x 1GbE ports and 2x 10GbE with the ability to specify the links to be bound, the port order if required, and the bonding type to be used. MAC address of the bond MUST be settable or taken from its first slave device. The example SHALL also allow the enable/disable of promiscuous mode and disabling of the bonding resulting in the return of the normal interfaces and the ability to bring up and down the logical bonded link.
  - Provide the performance for each of these modes.

This bonding test plan is mainly to test basic bonding APIs via testpmd and the supported modes(0-3) and each mode's performance in R1.7.

RX: Send a packet stream(100 packets) from port A on the traffic generator to be forwarded through the bonded port4 to port3. Verify the sum of the packets transmitted from the traffic generator portA is equal the total received packets on port0, port4 and portD(Traffic generator)::

    testpmd> show port stats all---(Verify port0 receive 100 packets, and port4 receive 100 packets, and port3 transmit 100 packets)

TX: Send a packet stream(100 packets) from portD on the traffic generator to be forwarded through port3 to the bonded port4. Verify the sum of the packets(100packets) transmitted from the traffic generator port is equal the total received packets on port4, portA and transmitted to port0.::

    testpmd> show port stats all---(Verify port3 RX 100 packets, and port0,1,2,4 TX 100 packets)

Test Case20: Mode 3(Broadcast) Bring one slave link down
========================================================

Bring one slave port link down. Send 100 packets through portD to port3, then port3 forwards to bonded device(port4), verify that the bonded device and other slaves TX the correct number of packets(100 packets for each port).


Test Case21: Mode 3(Broadcast) Bring all slave links down
=========================================================

Bring all slave ports of bonded port down
Verify that bonded callback for link down is called
Verify that data cannot be sent or received through bonded port.

Test Case22: Mode 3(Broadcast) Performance test--TBD
====================================================

Configure layer2 forwarding(testpmd) between bonded dev and a non bonded dev
Bi-directional flow:
Use IXIA to generate traffic to non bonded eth dev and port0.
Verify that tx packet are sent to all slave ports.
Measure performance through bonded eth dev and all slaves' mapped IXIA ports's RX.
Test with bonded port with slave ports 0,1,2.
Can try to reduce slave numbers from 3 to 2 to check if performance has any difference.
