Fortville RSS - Configuring Hash Function Tests
===============================================

This document provides test plan for testing the function of Fortville:
Support configuring hash functions.


Prerequisites
=============

* 2x IntelÂ® 82599 (Niantic) NICs (2x 10GbE full duplex optical ports per NIC)
* 1x Fortville_eagle NIC (4x 10G)
* 1x Fortville_spirit NIC (2x 40G)
* 2x Fortville_spirit_single NIC (1x 40G)

The four ports of the 82599 connect to the Fortville_eagle;
The two ports of Fortville_spirit connect to Fortville_spirit_single.
The three kinds of NICs are the target NICs. the connected NICs can send packets
to these three NICs using scapy.

Network Traffic
---------------

The RSS feature is designed to improve networking performance by load balancing
the packets received from a NIC port to multiple NIC RX queues, with each queue
handled by a different logical core.

#. The receive packet is parsed into the header fields used by the hash
   operation (such as IP addresses, TCP port, etc.)

#. A hash calculation is performed. The Fortville supports four hash function:
   Toeplitz, simple XOR and their Symmetric RSS.

#. The seven LSBs of the hash result are used as an index into a 128/512 entry
   'redirection table'. Each entry provides a 4-bit RSS output index.

#. There are four cases to test the four hash function.

Test Case:  test_toeplitz
=========================

Testpmd configuration - 16 RX/TX queues per port
------------------------------------------------

#. set up testpmd with fortville NICs::

      ./testpmd -c fffff -n %d -- -i --coremask=0xffffe --rxq=16 --txq=16

#. Reta Configuration.  128 reta entries configuration::

       testpmd command: port config 0 rss reta (hash_index,queue_id)

#. PMD fwd only receive the packets::

       testpmd command: set fwd rxonly

#. rss received package type configuration two received packet types configuration::

       testpmd command: port config 0 rss ip/udp

#. verbose configuration::

       testpmd command: set verbose 8

#. set hash functions, can choose symmetric or not, choose port and packet type::

       set_hash_function 0 toeplitz

#. start packet receive::

       testpmd command: start

tester Configuration
--------------------

#. set up scapy

#. send packets with different type ipv4/ipv4 with tcp/ipv4 with udp/
   ipv6/ipv6 with tcp/ipv6 with udp::

    sendp([Ether(dst="90:e2:ba:36:99:3c")/IP(src="192.168.0.4", dst="192.168.0.5")], iface="eth3")

test result
-----------

The testpmd will print the hash value and actual queue of every packet.

#. Calculate the queue id: hash value%128or512, then refer to the redirection table
   to get the theoretical queue id.

#. Compare the theoretical queue id with the actual queue id.


Test Case:  test_toeplitz_symmetric
===================================

The same with the above steps, pay attention to "set hash function", should use::

  set_hash_function 0 toeplitz
  set_sym_hash_ena_per_port 0 enable
  set_sym_hash_ena_per_pctype 0 35 enable

And send packets with the same flow in different direction::

  sendp([Ether(dst="90:e2:ba:36:99:3c")/IP(src="192.168.0.4", dst="192.168.0.5")], iface="eth3")
  sendp([Ether(dst="90:e2:ba:36:99:3c")/IP(src="192.168.0.5", dst="192.168.0.4")], iface="eth3")

And the hash value and queue should be the same for these two flow .

Test Case:  test_simple
=======================

The same as the above two test cases. Just pay attention to set the hash function to "simple xor"

Test Case:  test_simple_symmetric
=================================

The same as the above two test cases. Just pay attention to set the hash function to "simple xor"

Test Case:  test_dynamic_rss_bond_config
========================================
This case test bond slaves will auto sync rss hash config, it only support by fortville.

#. set up testpmd with fortville NICs::

      ./testpmd -c f -n 4 -- -i --portmask 0x3 --tx-offloads=0x8fff

#. create bond device with mode 3::

      create bonded device 3 0

#. add slave to bond device::

      add bonding slave 0 2
      add bonding slave 1 2

#. get default hash algorithm on slave::

      get_hash_global_config 0
      get_hash_global_config 1

#. set hash algorithm on slave 0::

      set_hash_global_config 0 simple_xor ipv4-other enable

#. get hash algorithm on slave 0 and 1::

      get_hash_global_config 0
      get_hash_global_config 1

#. check slave 0 and 1 use same hash algorithm
