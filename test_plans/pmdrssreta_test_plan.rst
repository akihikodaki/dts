Niantic Reta (Redirection table) Tests
======================================

This document provides test plan for benchmarking of Rss reta(Redirection
table) updating for the Intel® 82599 10 Gigabit Ethernet Controller
(Niantic) Poll Mode Driver (PMD) in userland runtime configurations.
The content of Rss Redirection table are not defined following reset
of the Memory Configuration registers. System software must initialize
the table prior to enabling multiple receive queues .It can also update
the redirection table during run time. Such updates of the table are
not synchronized with the arrival time of received packets.

Prerequisites
=============

2x Intel® 82599 (Niantic) NICs (2x 10GbE full duplex optical ports per NIC)
plugged into the available PCIe Gen2 8-lane slots. To avoid PCIe bandwidth
bottlenecks at high packet rates, a single optical port from each NIC is
connected to the traffic  generator.


Network Traffic
---------------

The RSS feature is designed to improve networking performance by load balancing
the packets received from a NIC port to multiple NIC RX queues, with each queue
handled by a different logical core.

#. The receive packet is parsed into the header fields used by the hash
   operation (such as IP addresses, TCP port, etc.)

#. A hash calculation is performed. The 82599 supports a single hash function,
   as defined by MSFT RSS. The 82599 therefore does not indicate to the device
   driver which hash function is used. The 32-bit result is fed into the
   packet receive descriptor.

#. The seven LSBs of the hash result are used as an index into a 128-entry
   'redirection table'. Each entry provides a 4-bit RSS output index.

The RSS RETA update feature is designed to make RSS more flexible by allowing
users to define the correspondence between the seven LSBs of hash result and
the queue id(RSS output index) by themself.


Test Case:  Results - IO Forwarding Mode
========================================

The following RX Ports/Queues configurations have to be benchmarked:

- 1 RX port / 2 RX queues (1P/2Q)

- 1 RX port / 9 RX queues (1P/9Q)

- 1 RX ports / 16 RX queues (1P/16Q)


Testpmd configuration - 2 RX/TX queues per port
-----------------------------------------------

::

  ./x86_64-native-linuxapp-gcc/app/dpdk-testpmd -c ffffff -n 3 -b 0000:05:00.1 -- -i --rxd=512 --txd=512 --burst=32 \
  --txpt=36 --txht=0 --txwt=0 --txfreet=32 --rxfreet=64 --txrst=32 --mbcache=128 \
  --rxq=2 --txq=2

Testpmd configuration - 9 RX/TX queues per port
-----------------------------------------------

::

  ./x86_64-native-linuxapp-gcc/app/dpdk-testpmd -c ffffff -n 3 -b 0000:05:00.1 -- -i --rxd=512 --txd=512 --burst=32 \
  --txpt=36 --txht=0 --txwt=0 --txfreet=32 --rxfreet=64 --txrst=32 --mbcache=128 \
  --rxq=9 --txq=9

Testpmd configuration - 16 RX/TX queues per port
------------------------------------------------

::

  ./x86_64-native-linuxapp-gcc/app/dpdk-testpmd -c ffffff -n 3 -b 0000:05:00.1 -- -i --rxd=512 --txd=512 --burst=32 \
  --txpt=36 --txht=0 --txwt=0 --txfreet=32 --rxfreet=64 --txrst=32 --mbcache=128 \
  --rxq=16 --txq=16

The -n command is used to select the number of memory channels. It should match the number of memory channels on that setup.
The -b command is used to prevent the use of pic port to receive packets. It should match the pci number of the pci device.

Testpmd Configuration Options
-----------------------------

By default, a single logical core runs the test.
The CPU IDs and the number of logical cores running the test in parallel can
be manually set with the ``set corelist X,Y`` and the ``set nbcore N``
interactive commands of the ``testpmd`` application.

#. Reta Configuration.  128 reta entries configuration::

     testpmd command: port config 0 rss reta (hash_index,queue_id)

#. PMD fwd only receive the packets::

     testpmd command: set fwd rxonly

#. rss received package type configuration two received packet types configuration::

     testpmd command: port config 0 rss ip/udp

#. Verbose configuration::

     testpmd command: set verbose 8

#. Start packet receive::

     testpmd command: start

tester Configuration
--------------------

#. In order to make most entries of the reta to be tested, the traffic
   generator has to be configured to randomize the value of the 5-tuple fields
   of the transmitted IP/UDP packets, so that RSS hash function output of
   5-tuple fields covers most of reta index.

#. Set the package numbers of one burst to a certain value.


Example output (1P/2Q)  received by the dut):::

Test Case:  Check RSS key size
==============================

Different NIC types support different RSS hasd key size.
Use the testpmd command::

  testpmd command: show port info all

Get the RSS hash key size::

  Hash key size in bytes: 52

Check the value to the key size supported by NIC.
