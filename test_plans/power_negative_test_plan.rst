========================
Power Negative Test Plan
========================

Preparation work
================
1. Turn on Speedstep option in BIOS
2. Turn on CPU C3 and C6
3. Turn on Turbo in BIOS
4. Disable intel_pstate in Linux kernel command: intel_pstate=disable
5. modprobe msr module to let the application can get the CPU HW info
6. Let user space can control the CPU frequency: cpupower frequency-set -g userspace


Test Case1: Inject Malformed JSON Command file to fifo channel
===============================================================
Step 1. Create powermonitor fold for vm_power_manager sample::

    mkdir /tmp/powermonitor
    chmod 777 /tmp/powermonitor

Step 2. Luanch VM power manager sample::

    ./x86_64-native-linuxapp-gcc/examples/dpdk-vm_power_manager -l 1-3 -n 4 --file-prefix=test1 --no-pci

Step 3. Prepare policy in JSON format then send it to the fifo channel:
    Prepare different command in JSON format then send it to the fifo channel
    Modify "name", "resource_id", "command" to large character string to check if the vm_power_mgr sample will crash
    For example::

      {"policy": {
        "name": "01234567890123445678901234567890123456789001234567890",
        "command": "create",
        "policy_type": "WORKLOAD",
        "workload": "MEDIUM",
      }}

Step 4. Send Json format command to the fifo channel::

  cat command.json > /tmp/powermonitor/fifo22

Check point: no crash at the vm_power_mgr application side.

Potential issue: no warning for the user for the name too long, now is char[32], but no crash as strlcpy is uesed

Test Case2: Send invalid command through JSON channel
======================================================
Step 1. Create powermonitor fold for vm_power_manager sample::

    mkdir /tmp/powermonitor
    chmod 777 /tmp/powermonitor

Step 2. Luanch VM power manager sample::

    ./x86_64-native-linuxapp-gcc/examples/dpdk-vm_power_manager -l 1-3 -n 4 --file-prefix=test1 --no-pci

Step 3. Prepare policy in JSON format then send it to the fifo channel:

Prepare invalid power command, for example, core list above the max core number. For example::

    {"policy": {
        "name": "Ubutnu",
        "command": "create",
        "policy_type": "WORKLOAD",
        "workload": "MEDIUM_111",
    }}

    {"policy": {
        "name": "Ubutnu",
        "command": "create",
        "policy_type": "WORKLOAD_111",
        "workload": "MEDIUM",
    }}

Step 4. Send Json format command to the fifo channel::

	cat command.json > /tmp/powermonitor/fifo22

Test Case3: Check if host power APP have check point for the power policy sent from untrusted VM
===================================================================================================
Step 1. Launch VM by using libvirt, one NIC should be configured as PCI pass-throughput to the VM::

    virsh start [VM name]

Note: For the VM xml file which will be used for creating the VM, it can re-use the vm0.xml generated in the branch ratio DTS script

Step 2. Luanch VM power manager sample on the host to monitor the channel from VM::

    ./x86_64-native-linuxapp-gcc/examples/dpdk-vm_power_manager -l 12-14 -n 4 --no-pci
      >　add_vm [vm name]
      >　add_channels [vm name] all
      >　set_channel_status [vm name] all enabled
      >　show_vm [vm name]

   Check the invalid input command for vm_power_mgr sample::

    > add_channels ubuntu 128
    > add_channel ubuntu 10000000000000000

Check point:　No crash should be occur at vm_power_mgr sample

Step 3. In the VM, launch guest_vm_power_mgr to set and send the power manager policy to the host power sample::

    ./x86_64-native-linuxapp-gcc/examples/dpdk-guest_cli -c 0xff -n 4 -m 1024 --no-pci --file-prefix=yaolei \
      -- --vm-name=ubuntu --vcpu-list=0-7
      > set_cpu_freq 128 down
      > set_cpu_freq 1000000000000 down
      > set_cpu_freq -1 down

   also try other commands::

     "<up|down|min|max|enable_turbo|disable_turbo>"


Test Case4: TRAFFIC Policy Test based on JSON configure file with large integer number
========================================================================================
Step 1. Generate 1 VF under vfio-pci driver, launch vm_power_mgr sample with PF, for example::

    echo 1 > /sys/bus/pci/drivers/vfio-pci/0000\:82\:00.0/max_vfs
    ./x86_64-native-linuxapp-gcc/examples/dpdk-vm_power_manager -l 1-4 -n 4 --socket-mem=1024,1024 --file-prefix=test1 -a 82:00.0 -- -p 0x01

Step 2. Launch testpmd with VF::

     ./x86_64-native-linuxapp-gcc/app/dpdk-testpmd -l 5-6 -n 4 --socket-mem=1024,1024 --file-prefix=test2 -a 0000:82:02.0 -- -i
       > set fwd macswap
       > start

Step 3. Prepare traffic policy in JSON format then send it to the power demon sample, put the VF MAC into the mac_list::

      {"policy": {
          "name": "ubuntu",
          "command": "create",
          "policy_type": "TRAFFIC",
          "max_packet_thresh": 500000000000000000000000000000,
          "avg_packet_thresh": 300000000000000000000000000000,
          "mac_list":[ "E0:E0:E0:E0:F0:F0"]
      }}

Step 4. Send Json format command to the fifo channel::

  cat traffic.json > /tmp/powermonitor/fifo6

Check point:　No crash should be occur at vm_power_mgr sample
