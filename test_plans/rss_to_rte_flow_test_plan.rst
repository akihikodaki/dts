Move RSS to rte_flow
====================
Description
===========

Generic flow API (rte_flow) has been actually defined to include RSS, but
till now, RSS is out of rte_flow. It was suggested to move existing RSS to
rte_flow. This can be better for users, and may save effort for CPK
development. RSS enabling: now, rte_flow API enabling RSS is support on
igb/ixgbe/i40e. RSS input set changing: now, rte flow API RSS input set is
support on i40e.

Notes: non-default RSS hash functions are not supported -- Operation not
supported.

Prerequisites
=============

1. Hardware:
   I40E/IXGBE/IGB driver NIC

2. Software:
   dpdk: http://dpdk.org/git/dpdk
   scapy: http://www.secdev.org/projects/scapy/

3. Bind the pf port to dpdk driver::

    ./usertools/dpdk-devbind.py -b igb_uio 05:00.0 05:00.1

4. Configure eight packets ready sent to port 0::

    pkt1 = Ether(dst="00:00:00:00:01:00")/IP(src="10.0.0.1",dst="192.168.0.2")/SCTP(dport=80, sport=80)/("X"*48)
    pkt2 = Ether(dst="00:00:00:00:01:00")/IP(src="10.0.0.1",dst="192.168.0.2")/UDP(dport=50, sport=50)/("X"*48)
    pkt3 = Ether(dst="00:00:00:00:01:00")/IP(src="10.0.0.1",dst="192.168.0.3")/TCP(dport=50, sport=50)/("X"*48)
    pkt4 = Ether(dst="00:00:00:00:01:00")/IP(src="10.0.0.1",dst="192.168.0.2")/("X"*48)
    pkt5 = Ether(dst="00:00:00:00:01:00")/IP(src="10.0.0.1",dst="192.168.0.2", frag=1)/Raw("X"*48)
    pkt6 = Ether(dst="00:00:00:00:01:00")/IPv6(src="2001::1",dst="2001::2",nh=132)/SCTP(dport=80, sport=80)/("X"*48)
    pkt7 = Ether(dst="00:00:00:00:01:00")/IPv6(src="2001::1",dst="2001::2")/UDP(dport=50, sport=50)/("X"*48)
    pkt8 = Ether(dst="00:00:00:00:01:00")/IPv6(src="2001::1",dst="2001::2")/TCP(dport=50, sport=50)/("X"*48)
    pkt9 = Ether(dst="00:00:00:00:01:00")/IPv6(src="2001::1",dst="2001::2")/("X"*48)
    pkt10 = Ether(dst="00:00:00:00:01:00")/IPv6(dst="CDCD:910A:2222:5498:8475:1111:3900:2020", nh=44)/("X"*48)
    pkt11 = Ether(dst="00:00:00:00:01:00", type=0x0807)/Raw(load="\x61\x62\x63\x64")

5. The rss setting commands are different between i40e driver and ixgbe/igb driver.
   So design different cases on i40e/ixgbe/igb.

I40E Cases
==========
Test case: set rss types on two ports (I40E)
============================================

1. Start the testpmd::

    ./<build_target>/app/dpdk-testpmd -c 1ffff -n 4 -- -i --nb-cores=8 --rxq=4 --txq=4 --port-topology=chained
    testpmd> set fwd rxonly
    testpmd> set verbose 1
    testpmd> start

   all the rules can be created successfully.
   then check the rule list::

    testpmd> flow list 1

   there are 11 rules listed correctly.
   then show the port RSS function::

    testpmd> show port 1 rss-hash
    RSS functions:

    1234567890123456789012345678901234567890FFFFFFFFFFFF1234567890123456789012345678901234567890FFFFFFFFFFFF

   Send the same five packets to port 0,
   pkt1 is distributed to queue 3.
   pkt2 is distributed to queue 2.
   pkt3 is distributed to queue 2.
   pkt4 is distributed to queue 0.
   pkt5 is distributed to queue 3.
   Send the same five packets to port 1, they are distributed to same queues with step 2.

4. Set ipv4-udp with truncating key_len::

    testpmd> flow create 0 ingress pattern eth / ipv4 / udp / end actions rss types ipv4-udp end queues end key \
    1234567890123456789012345678901234567890FFFFFFFFFFFF1234567890123456789012345678901234567890FFFFFFFFFFFF key_len 50 / end
    testpmd> show port 0 rss-hash key
    RSS functions:
     ipv4-udp udp
    RSS key:
    4439796BB54C5023B675EA5B124F9F30B8A2C03DDFDC4D02A08C9B334AF64A4C05C6FA343958D8557D99583AE138C92E81150366

   Send the same five packets to port 0,
   pkt1 is distributed to queue 3.
   pkt2 is distributed to queue 3.
   pkt3 is distributed to queue 0.
   pkt4 is distributed to queue 1.
   pkt5 is distributed to queue 0.
   Send the same five packets to port 1, they are distributed to same queues with step 2.

   The key length is 52 bytes, if setting it shorter than 52, the key value doesn't take effect.
   The showed key value is an invalid value, not the default value.
   The key length is different among different NIC types.

5. Set ipv4-udp with padding key_len::

    testpmd> flow create 0 ingress pattern eth / ipv4 / udp / end actions rss types ipv4-udp end queues end key \
    1234567890123456789012345678901234567890FFFFFFFFFFFF1234567890123456789012345678901234567890FFFFFF key_len 52 / end
    testpmd> show port 0 rss-hash key
    RSS functions:
     ipv4-udp udp
    RSS key:
    1234567890123456789012345678901234567890FFFFFFFFFFFF1234567890123456789012345678901234567890FFFFFF657474

   Send the same five packets to port 0,
   pkt1 is distributed to queue 3.
   pkt2 is distributed to queue 2.
   pkt3 is distributed to queue 2.
   pkt4 is distributed to queue 0.
   pkt5 is distributed to queue 3.
   Send the same five packets to port 1, they are distributed to same queues with step 2.

   The lengh of key is 49 bytes, but the key_len is 52,
   so the last three bytes of key is padded by default value.

6. Set ipv4-udp key on port 1::

    testpmd> flow create 1 ingress pattern eth / ipv4 / udp / end actions rss types ipv4-udp end queues end key \
    1234567890123456789012345678901234567890FFFFFFFFFFFF1234567890123456789012345678909876543210EEEEEEEEEEEE / end
    testpmd> show port 1 rss-hash key
    RSS functions:
     ipv4-udp udp
    RSS key:
    1234567890123456789012345678901234567890FFFFFFFFFFFF1234567890123456789012345678909876543210EEEEEEEEEEEE

   Send the same five packets to port 0, they are distributed to same queues with step 5.
   Send the same five packets to port 1,
   pkt1 is distributed to queue 3.
   pkt2 is distributed to queue 2.
   pkt3 is distributed to queue 2.
   pkt4 is distributed to queue 0.
   pkt5 is distributed to queue 3.

Test case: Flow directory rule and RSS rule combination (I40E)
==============================================================

1. Start the testpmd::

    ./<build_target>/app/dpdk-testpmd -c 1ffff -n 4 -- -i --nb-cores=8 --rxq=16 --txq=16 --pkt-filter-mode=perfect
    testpmd> set fwd rxonly
    testpmd> set verbose 1
    testpmd> start

2. Set a RSS queue rule::

    testpmd> flow create 0 ingress pattern eth / ipv4 / udp / end actions rss types ipv4-udp end queues end / end
    testpmd> flow create 0 ingress pattern end actions rss types end queues 6 7 8 end / end

   Send ipv4-udp packet to port 0, distributed to queue 8.

3. Set a flow directory rule::

    testpmd> flow create 0 ingress pattern eth / ipv4 src is 10.0.0.1 dst is 192.168.0.2 / udp src is 50 dst is 50 / end actions queue index 1 / end

   Send pkt2 to port 0, pkt2 is distributed to queue 1.

4. Destroy the flow directory rule::

    testpmd> flow destroy 0 rule 2

   Send pkt2 to port 0, pkt2 is distributed to queue 8 again.
   So flow directory filter is priority to RSS hash filter.

Test case: Set queue-region with rte_flow api (I40E)
====================================================
 
1. Start the testpmd::

    ./<build_target>/app/dpdk-testpmd -c 1ffff -n 4 -- -i --nb-cores=16 --rxq=16 --txq=16 --port-topology=chained
    testpmd> set fwd rxonly
    testpmd> set verbose 1
    testpmd> start

2. Set a RSS queue rule::

    testpmd> flow create 0 ingress pattern end actions rss types end queues 7 8 10 11 12 14 15 end / end
    testpmd> flow create 0 ingress pattern eth / ipv4 / tcp / end actions rss types ipv4-tcp end queues end / end

3. Send pkt to port 0::

    pkt1 = Ether(dst="00:00:00:00:01:00", src="52:00:00:00:00:00")/Dot1Q(prio=1) \
    /IP(src="10.0.0.1",dst="192.168.0.2")/TCP(dport=80, sport=80)/("X"*48)
    pkt2 = Ether(dst="00:00:00:00:01:00", src="52:00:00:00:00:00")/Dot1Q(prio=2) \
    /IP(src="10.0.0.1",dst="192.168.0.2")/TCP(dport=80, sport=80)/("X"*48)
    pkt3 = Ether(dst="00:00:00:00:01:00", src="52:00:00:00:00:00")/Dot1Q(prio=3) \
    /IP(src="10.0.0.1",dst="192.168.0.2")/TCP(dport=80, sport=80)/("X"*48)

   They are all distributed to queue 8.

4. Set three queue regions::

    testpmd> flow create 0 ingress pattern vlan tci is 0x2000 / end actions rss queues 7 8 end / end
    testpmd> flow create 0 ingress pattern vlan tci is 0x4000 / end actions rss queues 11 12 end / end
    testpmd> flow create 0 ingress pattern vlan tci is 0x6000 / end actions rss queues 15 end / end

   Send the 3 packets to port 0. They are distributed to queue 7/11/15.
   So the flow directory filter is priority to RSS hash filter.

5. Flush the L2-payload rule::

    testpmd> flow list 0
    ID      Group   Prio    Attr    Rule
    0       0       0       i-      => RSS
    1       0       0       i-      ETH IPV4 TCP => RSS
    2       0       0       i-      VLAN => RSS
    3       0       0       i-      VLAN => RSS
    4       0       0       i-      VLAN => RSS

    testpmd> flow destroy 0 rule 3
    Flow rule #3 destroyed
    testpmd> flow list 0
    ID      Group   Prio    Attr    Rule
    0       0       0       i-      => RSS
    1       0       0       i-      ETH IPV4 TCP => RSS
    2       0       0       i-      VLAN => RSS
    4       0       0       i-      VLAN => RSS

   Send the 3 packets to port 0. They are all distributed to queue 8.
   Queue region only can be deleted all or none.

Test case: Set queue region in rte_flow with invalid parameter (I40E)
=====================================================================

1. Start the testpmd::

    ./<build_target>/app/dpdk-testpmd -c 1ffff -n 4 -- -i --nb-cores=16 --rxq=16 --txq=16 --port-topology=chained
    testpmd> set fwd rxonly
    testpmd> set verbose 1
    testpmd> start

2. Set a queue region::

    testpmd> flow create 0 ingress pattern vlan tci is 0x2000 / end actions rss queues 10 11 end / end
    port_flow_complain(): Caught PMD error type 16 (specific action): cause: 0x7ffeb4a60fd8, no valid queues: Invalid argument

3. Set a RSS queue rule first::

    testpmd> flow create 0 ingress pattern end actions rss types end queues 8 10 11 12 15 end / end

4. Set invalid queue ID "9" to queue region::

    testpmd> flow create 0 ingress pattern vlan tci is 0x2000 / end actions rss queues 8 9 end / end
    Caught error type 11 (specific action): cause: 0x7ffda008efe8, no valid queues

   Queue of queue region must be included in rss function appointed queue.

5. Set discontinuous queue ID to queue region::

    testpmd> flow create 0 ingress pattern vlan tci is 0x2000 / end actions rss queues 8 10 end / end
    Caught error type 11 (specific action): cause: 0x7ffda008efe8, no valid queues

6. Set invalid queue number to queue region::

    testpmd> flow create 0 ingress pattern vlan tci is 0x4000 / end actions rss queues 10 11 12 end / end
    i40e_flow_parse_rss_action(): The region sizes should be any of the following values: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64 as long as the total number of queues do not exceed the VSI allocation
    Caught error type 2 (flow rule (handle)): Failed to create flow.

7. Set a queue region::

    testpmd> flow create 0 ingress pattern vlan tci is 0x2000 / end actions rss queues 10 11 end / end
    Flow rule #1 created

Test case: Queue region and RSS rule combination (I40E)
=======================================================

Notes: Queue region is only supported by fortville, so this case only can
be implemented with fortville.

1. Start the testpmd::

    ./<build_target>/app/dpdk-testpmd -c 1ffff -n 4 -- -i --nb-cores=8 --rxq=16 --txq=16 --port-topology=chained
    testpmd> flow create 0 ingress pattern eth / ipv4 / udp / end actions rss types ipv4-udp end queues end / end
    testpmd> set fwd rxonly
    testpmd> set verbose 1
    testpmd> start

2. Set a queue region::

    testpmd> set port 0 queue-region region_id 0 queue_start_index 1 queue_num 1
    testpmd> set port 0 queue-region region_id 0 flowtype 31
    testpmd> set port 0 queue-region flush on

   Send ipv4-udp packet to port 0. It is distributed to queue 1.

3. Set a RSS queue rule::

    testpmd> flow create 0 ingress pattern end actions rss types end queues 6 7 end / end

   Send ipv4-udp packet to port 0. It is still distributed to queue 1.

4. flush the queue region::

    testpmd> set port 0 queue-region flush off 

   Send ipv4-udp packet to port 0. It is distributed to queue 7.
   Queue region is priority to RSS queue rule.


IXGBE/IGB cases
===============
IXGBE/IGB doesn't support L2-payload ptype.

Test case: disable and enable rss
=================================

1. Start the testpmd::

     ipv4 ipv6 ipv6-ex

   Send the ipv4-other/ipv4-udp/ipv4-tcp/ipv4-sctp/ipv4-frag/ipv6-other/ipv6-frag/ipv6-udp/ipv6-tcp/ipv6-sctp packets with different src/dst ip address.
   All the packets are distributed to all the four queues.

3. disable all RSS fuctions::

    testpmd> flow create 0 ingress pattern end actions rss types none end / end
    Flow rule #0 created
    testpmd> show port 0 rss-hash
    RSS disabled

   Send the ipv4-other/ipv4-udp/ipv4-tcp/ipv4-sctp/ipv4-frag/ipv6-other/ipv6-frag/ipv6-udp/ipv6-tcp/ipv6-sctp packets with different src/dst ip address.
   All the packets are distributed to queue 0.

4. enable RSS fuction with all RSS hash type::

    testpmd> flow create 0 ingress pattern end actions rss types all end / end
    Flow rule #1 created
    testpmd> show port 0 rss-hash
    RSS functions:
     ipv4 ipv4-tcp ipv4-udp ipv6 ipv6-tcp ipv6-udp ipv6-ex ipv6-tcp-ex ipv6-udp-ex

   Send the ipv4-other/ipv4-udp/ipv4-tcp/ipv4-sctp/ipv4-frag/ipv6-other/ipv6-frag/ipv6-udp/ipv6-tcp/ipv6-sctp packets with different src/dst ip address.
   All the packets are distributed to all the four queues.

Notes: the default RSS functions may be different among several NICs.

Test case: enable ipv4-udp rss
==============================

1. Start the testpmd::

    ./<build_target>/app/dpdk-testpmd -c 1ffff -n 4 -- -i --nb-cores=8 --rxq=4 --txq=4 --port-topology=chained
    testpmd> set fwd rxonly
    testpmd> set verbose 1
    testpmd> start

2. Show port default RSS fuctions::

    testpmd> show port 0 rss-hash
    RSS functions:
     all ipv4 ipv6 ipv6-ex ip

3. Enable ipv4-udp, and set all the queues into RSS queue rule::

    testpmd> flow create 0 ingress pattern end actions rss types ipv4-udp end / end
    Flow rule #0 created
    testpmd> show port 0 rss-hash
    RSS functions:
     ipv4-udp

   Send the ipv4-other/ipv4-tcp/ipv4-sctp/ipv4-frag/ipv6-other/ipv6-frag/ipv6-udp/ipv6-tcp/ipv6-sctp packets with different src/dst ip address.
   All the packets are distributed to queue 0.
   Send the ipv4-udp packets with different src/dst ip and sport/dport.
   All the packets are distributed to all the four queues.

Test case: set rss valid/invalid queue rule
===========================================

1. Start the testpmd::

    ./<build_target>/app/dpdk-testpmd -c 1ffff -n 4 -- -i --nb-cores=8 --rxq=16 --txq=16 --port-topology=chained
    testpmd> set fwd rxonly
    testpmd> set verbose 1
    testpmd> start

2. Set queue 0, 8 and 15 into RSS queue rule::

    testpmd> flow create 0 ingress pattern end actions rss queues 0 8 15 end / end

   Send the ipv4-other/ipv4-udp/ipv4-tcp/ipv4-sctp/ipv4-frag/ipv6-other/ipv6-frag/ipv6-udp/ipv6-tcp/ipv6-sctp packets with different src/dst ip address.
   All the packets are distributed to queue 0/8/15.

3. Set a second RSS queue rule::

    testpmd> flow create 0 ingress pattern end actions rss queues 3 end / end
    testpmd> flow create 0 ingress pattern end actions rss types ipv4-udp end queues 3 end / end

   The two rules failed to be created.
   There can't be more than one RSS queue rule.

4. Reset the RSS queue rule::

    testpmd> flow flush 0
    testpmd> flow create 0 ingress pattern end actions rss types ipv4-udp end queues 3 end / end

   The rule is set successfully.
   Send the ipv4-other/ipv4-tcp/ipv4-sctp/ipv4-frag/ipv6-other/ipv6-frag/ipv6-udp/ipv6-tcp/ipv6-sctp packets with different src/dst ip address.
   All the packets are distributed to queue 0.
   Send the ipv4-udp packets with different src/dst ip and sport/dport.
   All the packets are distributed to queue 3.

5. Set a wrong parameter: queue ID is 16 ::

    testpmd> flow flush 0
    testpmd> flow create 0 ingress pattern end actions rss queues 16 end / end

   The rule failed to be created.

6. Set all the queues to the rule::

    testpmd> flow create 0 ingress pattern end actions rss queues 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 end / end

   Send the ipv4-other/ipv4-udp/ipv4-tcp/ipv4-sctp/ipv4-frag/ipv6-other/ipv6-frag/ipv6-udp/ipv6-tcp/ipv6-sctp packets with different src/dst ip address.
   The packets may be distributed to any of the queue 0-15.

Notes: The max queue number may be different in different NIC types.
We can set different queue number in command line with different NIC types.

Test case: Different packet types
=================================

1. Start the testpmd::

    ./<build_target>/app/dpdk-testpmd -c 1ffff -n 4 -- -i --nb-cores=8 --rxq=16 --txq=16 --port-topology=chained
    testpmd> set fwd rxonly
    testpmd> set verbose 1
    testpmd> start

2. Set queue 1, 8 and 15 into RSS queue rule::

    testpmd> flow create 0 ingress pattern end actions rss types udp ipv4-tcp ipv6-sctp ipv4-other end queues 1 8 15 end / end
    testpmd> show port 0 rss-hash
    RSS functions:
     ipv4-tcp ipv4-udp ipv6-udp ipv6-udp-ex udp

3. Send ipv4-other/ipv4-udp/ipv4-tcp/ipv4-sctp/ipv4-frag/ipv6-other/ipv6-frag/ipv6-udp/ipv6-tcp/ipv6-sctp packets with different src/dst ip address.
   ipv4-udp/ipv4-tcp/ipv6-udp are distributed to queue 1/8/15.
   Other packets are distributed to queue 0.

4. Set a different packet type RSS queue rule::

    testpmd> flow flush 0
    testpmd> flow create 0 ingress pattern end actions rss types ipv6 ipv4 end queues 3 8 end / end
    testpmd> show port 0 rss-hash
    RSS functions:
     ipv4 ipv6

5. Send ipv4-other/ipv4-udp/ipv4-tcp/ipv4-sctp/ipv4-frag/ipv6-other/ipv6-frag/ipv6-udp/ipv6-tcp/ipv6-sctp packets with different src/dst ip address.
   all the packets are distributed to queue 1/8/15.

Notes: IXGBE only support udp/tcp ptype enabling alone,
not support ipv4-other/ipv4-sctp/ipv4-frag/ipv6-other/ipv6-frag/ipv6-sctp enabling alone.

Test case: disable rss in command-line
======================================

1. Start the testpmd::

    ./<build_target>/app/dpdk-testpmd -c 0x3 -n 4 -- -i --rxq=8 --txq=8 --disable-rss --port-topology=chained
    testpmd> set fwd rxonly
    testpmd> set verbose 1
    testpmd> start

2. Send ipv4-other/ipv4-udp/ipv4-tcp/ipv4-sctp/ipv4-frag/ipv6-other/ipv6-frag/ipv6-udp/ipv6-tcp/ipv6-sctp packets with different src/dst ip address.
   All the packets are distributed to queue 0.

3. enable all RSS function type::

    testpmd> flow create 0 ingress pattern end actions rss types all end / end

   Send ipv4-other/ipv4-udp/ipv4-tcp/ipv4-sctp/ipv4-frag/ipv6-other/ipv6-frag/ipv6-udp/ipv6-tcp/ipv6-sctp packets with different src/dst ip address.
   All the packets are distributed to any of queue 0-7

4. Clean the rule::

    testpmd> flow flush 0

   Send the all type packets to port 0.
   All the packets are distributed to queue 0.

5. Set the RSS queue rule::

    testpmd> flow create 0 ingress pattern end actions rss types ipv6-tcp ipv4-udp end queues 5 6 7 end / end

   Send ipv4-udp/ipv6-tcp packets with different src/dst ip address.
   All the packets are distributed to queue 5/6/7.
   Send ipv4-other/ipv4-tcp/ipv4-sctp/ipv4-frag/ipv6-other/ipv6-frag/ipv6-udp/ipv6-sctp packets with different src/dst ip address.
   All the packets are distributed to queue 0.

Test case: Flow directory rule and RSS rule combination
=======================================================

1. Start the testpmd::

    ./<build_target>/app/dpdk-testpmd -c 1ffff -n 4 -- -i --nb-cores=8 --rxq=16 --txq=16 --pkt-filter-mode=perfect
    testpmd> set fwd rxonly
    testpmd> set verbose 1
    testpmd> start

2. Set a RSS queue rule::

    testpmd> flow create 0 ingress pattern end actions rss types ipv4-udp end queues 6 7 8 end / end

   Send pkt2 to port 0, pkt2 is distributed to queue 8.

3. Set a flow directory rule::

    testpmd> flow create 0 ingress pattern eth / ipv4 src is 10.0.0.1 dst is 192.168.0.2 / udp src is 50 dst is 50 / end actions queue index 1 / end

   Send pkt2 to port 0, pkt2 is distributed to queue 1.

4. Destroy the flow directory rule::

    testpmd> flow destroy 0 rule 1

   Send pkt2 to port 0, pkt2 is distributed to queue 8 again.
   So flow directory filter is priority to RSS hash filter.
