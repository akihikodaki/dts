Shutdown API Feature Tests
==========================

This tests for Shutdown API feature can be run on linux userspace. It
will check if NIC port can be stopped and restarted without exiting the
application process. Furthermore, it will check if it can reconfigure
new configurations for a port after the port is stopped, and if it is
able to restart with those new configurations. It is based on testpmd
application.

The test is performed by running the testpmd application and using a
traffic generator. Port/queue configurations can be set interactively,
and still be set at the command line when launching the application in
order to be compatible with previous test framework.

Prerequisites
-------------

If using vfio the kernel must be >= 3.6+ and VT-d must be enabled in bios.When
using vfio, use the following commands to load the vfio driver and bind it
to the device under test::

   modprobe vfio
   modprobe vfio-pci
   usertools/dpdk-devbind.py --bind=vfio-pci device_bus_id

Assume port A and B are connected to the remote ports, e.g. packet generator.
To run the testpmd application in linuxapp environment with 4 lcores,
4 channels with other default parameters in interactive mode::

    $ ./app/dpdk-testpmd -c 0xf -n 4 -- -i
