Unit Tests: Dump Ring
=====================

This is the test plan for dumping the elements of Intel® DPDK ring.

This section explains how to run the unit tests for dumping elements of ring.
The test can be launched independently using the command line interface.
This test is implemented as a linuxapp environment application.

The complete test suite is launched automatically using a python-expect
script (launched using ``make test``) that sends commands to
the application and checks the results. A test report is displayed on
stdout.

The steps to run the unit test manually are as follow::

  Build dpdk
  # cd dpdk
  # CC=gcc meson --werror -Denable_kmods=True  -Dlibdir=lib --default-library=static x86_64-native-linuxapp-gcc
  # ninja -C x86_64-native-linuxapp-gcc -j 50

  # ./x86_64-native-linuxapp-gcc/app/test/dpdk-test -n 1 -c ffff
  RTE>> dump_ring

The final output of the test will be detailed elements of DPDK ring.
