=========================
Unit Tests: Power Library
=========================

This is the test plan for the IntelÂ® DPDK Power library.

Description
===========

This section explains how to run the unit tests for Power features. The test
can be launched independently using the command line interface.
This test is implemented as a linuxapp environment application.

The complete test suite is launched automatically using a python-expect
script (launched using ``make test``) that sends commands to
the application and checks the results. A test report is displayed on
stdout.

.. Note::

   * In the BIOS, turn on SpeedStep.


The steps to run the unit test manually are as follow::


  Build dpdk
  # cd dpdk
  # CC=gcc meson --werror -Denable_kmods=True  -Dlibdir=lib --default-library=static x86_64-native-linuxapp-gcc
  # ninja -C x86_64-native-linuxapp-gcc -j 50

  # ./x86_64-native-linuxapp-gcc/app/test/dpdk-test -n 1 -c ffff
  RTE>> power_autotest


The final output of the test has to be "Test OK"
