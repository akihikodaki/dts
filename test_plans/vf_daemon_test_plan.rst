VFD as SRIOV Policy Manager Tests
=================================

VFD is SRIOV Policy Manager (daemon) running on the host allowing
configuration not supported by kernel NIC driver, supports ixgbe and
i40e drivers' NIC. Run on the host for policy decisions w.r.t. what a
VF can and cannot do to the PF. Only the DPDK PF would provide a callback
to implement these features, the normal kernel drivers would not have the
callback so would not support the features. Allow passing information to
application controlling PF when VF message box event received such as those
listed below, so action could be taken based on host policy. Stop VM1 from
asking for something that compromises VM2.

Multiple purposes:

#. set VF MAC anti-spoofing
#. set VF VLAN anti-spoofing
#. set TX loopback
#. set VF unicast promiscuous mode
#. set VF multicast promiscuous mode
#. set VF MTU
#. get/reset VF stats
#. set VF MAC address
#. set VF VLAN stripping
#. VF VLAN insertion
#. set VF broadcast mode
#. set VF VLAN tag
#. set VF VLAN filter
#. Set/reset the queue drop enable bit for all pools(only ixgbe support)
#. Set/reset the enable drop bit in the split receive control register
    (only ixgbe support)

VFD also includes VF to PF mailbox message management by APP. When PF
receives mailbox messages from VF, PF should call the callback provided
by APP to know if they're permitted to be processed.

Prerequisites
=============

1. Host PF in DPDK driver. Create 2 VFs from 1 PF with dpdk driver,take
   Niantic for example::

        ./tools/dpdk-devbind.py -b igb_uio 81:00.0
        echo 2 >/sys/bus/pci/devices/0000:81:00.0/max_vfs

2. Detach VFs from the host::

        rmmod ixgbevf
