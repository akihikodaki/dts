VFD as SRIOV Policy Manager Tests
=================================

VFD is SRIOV Policy Manager (daemon) running on the host allowing
configuration not supported by kernel NIC driver, supports ixgbe and
i40e NIC. Run on the host for policy decisions w.r.t. what a VF can and
cannot do to the PF. Only the DPDK PF would provide a callback to implement 
these features, the normal kernel drivers would not have the callback so 
would not support the features. Allow passing information to application 
controlling PF when VF message box event received such as those listed below, 
so action could be taken based on host policy. Stop VM1 from asking for 
something that compromises VM2. Use DPDK DPDK PF + kernel VF mode to verify 
below features. 

Test Case 1: Set up environment and load driver
===============================================
1. Get the pci device id of DUT, load ixgbe driver to required version, 
   take Niantic for example::

    rmmod ixgbe
    insmod ixgbe.ko

2. Host PF in DPDK driver. Create VFs from PF with dpdk driver::

	./tools/dpdk-devbind.py -b igb_uio 05:00.0
	echo 2 >/sys/bus/pci/devices/0000\:05\:00.0/max_vfs 
	
3. Check ixgbevf version and update ixgbevf to required version
	
4. Detach VFs from the host::

    rmmod ixgbevf

5. Pass through VF 05:10.0 and 05:10.2 to VM0,start and login VM0
