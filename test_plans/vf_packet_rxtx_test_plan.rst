VF Packet RxTX Tests
====================



Test Case 1: VF_packet_IO_kernel_PF_dpdk_VF
===========================================

1. Got the pci device id of DUT, for example::

      ./dpdk_nic_bind.py --st

      0000:81:00.0 'Ethernet Controller X710 for 10GbE SFP+' if=ens259f0 drv=i40e unused=
      0000:81:00.1 'Ethernet Controller X710 for 10GbE SFP+' if=ens259f1 drv=i40e unused=

2. Create 2 VFs from 2 PFs::

      echo 1 > /sys/bus/pci/devices/0000\:81\:00.0/sriov_numvfs
      echo 1 > /sys/bus/pci/devices/0000\:81\:00.1/sriov_numvfs
      ./dpdk_nic_bind.py --st

      0000:81:00.0 'Ethernet Controller X710 for 10GbE SFP+' if=ens259f0 drv=i40e unused=
      0000:81:00.1 'Ethernet Controller X710 for 10GbE SFP+' if=ens259f1 drv=i40e unused=
      0000:81:02.0 'XL710/X710 Virtual Function' unused=
      0000:81:0a.0 'XL710/X710 Virtual Function' unused=

3. Detach VFs from the host, bind them to pci-stub driver::

      /sbin/modprobe pci-stub

      using `lspci -nn|grep -i ethernet` got VF device id, for example "8086 154c",

      echo "8086 154c" > /sys/bus/pci/drivers/pci-stub/new_id
      echo 0000:81:02.0 > /sys/bus/pci/devices/0000:08:02.0/driver/unbind
      echo 0000:81:02.0 > /sys/bus/pci/drivers/pci-stub/bind

      echo "8086 154c" > /sys/bus/pci/drivers/pci-stub/new_id
      echo 0000:81:0a.0 > /sys/bus/pci/devices/0000:08:0a.0/driver/unbind
      echo 0000:81:0a.0 > /sys/bus/pci/drivers/pci-stub/bind

   or using the following more easy way::

      virsh nodedev-detach pci_0000_81_02_0;
      virsh nodedev-detach pci_0000_81_0a_0;

      ./dpdk_nic_bind.py --st

      0000:81:00.0 'Ethernet Controller X710 for 10GbE SFP+' if=ens259f0 drv=i40e unused=
      0000:81:00.1 'Ethernet Controller X710 for 10GbE SFP+' if=ens259f1 drv=i40e unused=
      0000:81:02.0 'XL710/X710 Virtual Function' if= drv=pci-stub unused=
      0000:81:0a.0 'XL710/X710 Virtual Function' if= drv=pci-stub unused=

   it can be seen that VFs 81:02.0 & 81:0a.0 's drv is pci-stub.

4. Passthrough VFs 81:02.0 & 81:0a.0 to vm0, and start vm0::

      /usr/bin/qemu-system-x86_64  -name vm0 -enable-kvm \
      -cpu host -smp 4 -m 2048 -drive file=/home/image/sriov-fc20-1.img -vnc :1 \
      -device pci-assign,host=81:02.0,id=pt_0 \
      -device pci-assign,host=81:0a.0,id=pt_1

5. Login vm0, got VFs pci device id in vm0, assume they are 00:06.0 & 00:07.0, bind them to igb_uio driver,
   and then start testpmd, set it in mac forward mode::

      ./tools/dpdk_nic_bind.py --bind=igb_uio 00:06.0 00:07.0
      ./x86_64-native-linuxapp-gcc/app/testpmd -c 0x0f -n 4 -w 00:06.0 -w 00:07.0 \
                                               -- -i --portmask=0x3 --tx-offloads=0x8fff

      testpmd> set fwd mac
      testpmd> start

6. Get mac address of one VF and use it as dest mac, using scapy to send 2000 random packets from tester,
   verify the packets can be received by one VF and can be forward to another VF correctly.
