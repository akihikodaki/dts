VF RSS - Configuring Hash Function Tests
========================================

This document provides test plan for testing the function of Fortville:
Support configuring hash functions.

Prerequisites
-------------

* 2x Intel? 82599 (Niantic) NICs (2x 10GbE full duplex optical ports per NIC)
* 1x Fortville_eagle NIC (4x 10G)
* 1x Fortville_spirit NIC (2x 40G)
* 2x Fortville_spirit_single NIC (1x 40G)

The one port of the 82599 connect to the Fortville_eagle;
The one port of Fortville_spirit connect to Fortville_spirit_single.
The three kinds of NICs are the target NICs. the connected NICs can send packets
to these three NICs using scapy.

Network Traffic
---------------

The RSS feature is designed to improve networking performance by load balancing
the packets received from a NIC port to multiple NIC RX queues, with each queue
handled by a different logical core.

#. The receive packet is parsed into the header fields used by the hash
   operation (such as IP addresses, TCP port, etc.)

#. A hash calculation is performed. The Fortville  supports three hash function:
   Toeplitz, simple XOR and their Symmetric RSS.

#. Hash result are used as an index into a 128/512 entry
   'redirection table'.

#. Niantic VF only support simple default hash algorithm(simple). Fortville NIC
   support all hash algorithm only used dpdk driver on host. when used kernel driver on host,
   fortville nic only support default hash algorithm(simple).

The RSS RETA update feature is designed to make RSS more flexible by allowing
users to define the correspondence between the seven LSBs of hash result and
the queue id(RSS output index) by them self.


Test Case:  test_rss_hash
=========================

The following RX Ports/Queues configurations have to be benchmarked:

- 1 RX port / 4 RX queues (1P/4Q)


Testpmd configuration - 4 RX/TX queues per port
-----------------------------------------------

::

  testpmd -c 1f -n 3  -- -i --rxq=4 --txq=4 --tx-offloads=0x8fff

Testpmd Configuration Options
-----------------------------

By default, a single logical core runs the test.
The CPU IDs and the number of logical cores running the test in parallel can
be manually set with the ``set corelist X,Y`` and the ``set nbcore N``
interactive commands of the ``testpmd`` application.

1. Got the pci device id of DUT, for example::

     ./dpdk_nic_bind.py --st

     0000:81:00.0 'Ethernet Controller X710 for 10GbE SFP+' if=ens259f0 drv=i40e unused=
     0000:81:00.1 'Ethernet Controller X710 for 10GbE SFP+' if=ens259f1 drv=i40e unused=

2. Create 2 VFs from 2 PFs::

     echo 1 > /sys/bus/pci/devices/0000\:81\:00.0/sriov_numvfs
     echo 1 > /sys/bus/pci/devices/0000\:81\:00.1/sriov_numvfs
     ./dpdk_nic_bind.py --st

     0000:81:00.0 'Ethernet Controller X710 for 10GbE SFP+' if=ens259f0 drv=i40e unused=
     0000:81:00.1 'Ethernet Controller X710 for 10GbE SFP+' if=ens259f1 drv=i40e unused=
     0000:81:02.0 'XL710/X710 Virtual Function' unused=
     0000:81:0a.0 'XL710/X710 Virtual Function' unused=

3. Detach VFs from the host, bind them to pci-stub driver::

     /sbin/modprobe pci-stub

   using ``lspci -nn|grep -i ethernet`` got VF device id, for example "8086 154c"::

     echo "8086 154c" > /sys/bus/pci/drivers/pci-stub/new_id
     echo 0000:81:02.0 > /sys/bus/pci/devices/0000:08:02.0/driver/unbind
     echo 0000:81:02.0 > /sys/bus/pci/drivers/pci-stub/bind

     echo "8086 154c" > /sys/bus/pci/drivers/pci-stub/new_id
     echo 0000:81:0a.0 > /sys/bus/pci/devices/0000:08:0a.0/driver/unbind
     echo 0000:81:0a.0 > /sys/bus/pci/drivers/pci-stub/bind

  or using the following more easy way::

     virsh nodedev-detach pci_0000_81_02_0;
     virsh nodedev-detach pci_0000_81_0a_0;

     ./dpdk_nic_bind.py --st

     0000:81:00.0 'Ethernet Controller X710 for 10GbE SFP+' if=ens259f0 drv=i40e unused=
     0000:81:00.1 'Ethernet Controller X710 for 10GbE SFP+' if=ens259f1 drv=i40e unused=
     0000:81:02.0 'XL710/X710 Virtual Function' if= drv=pci-stub unused=
     0000:81:0a.0 'XL710/X710 Virtual Function' if= drv=pci-stub unused=

  it can be seen that VFs 81:02.0 & 81:0a.0 's drv is pci-stub.

4. Passthrough VFs 81:02.0 & 81:0a.0 to vm0, and start vm0::

     /usr/bin/qemu-system-x86_64  -name vm0 -enable-kvm \
     -cpu host -smp 4 -m 2048 -drive file=/home/image/sriov-fc20-1.img -vnc :1 \
     -device pci-assign,host=81:02.0,id=pt_0 \
     -device pci-assign,host=81:0a.0,id=pt_1

5. Login vm0, got VFs pci device id in vm0, assume they are 00:06.0 & 00:07.0,
   bind them to igb_uio driver, and then start testpmd, set it in mac forward
   mode::

     ./tools/dpdk_nic_bind.py --bind=igb_uio 00:06.0 00:07.0

6. Reta Configuration.  128 reta entries configuration::

     testpmd command: port config 0 rss reta (hash_index,queue_id)

7. Pmd fwd only receive the packets::

     testpmd command: set fwd rxonly

8. Rss received package type configuration two received packet types configuration::

     testpmd command: port config 0 rss ip/udp/tcp

9. Verbose configuration::

     testpmd command: set verbose 8

10. Start packet receive::

      testpmd command: start

11. Send packet and check rx port received packet by different queue.
    different hash type send different packet, example hash type is ip, packet src and dts ip not different::

      sendp([Ether(dst="90:e2:ba:36:99:3c")/IP(src="192.168.0.4", dst="192.168.0.5")], iface="eth3")
      sendp([Ether(dst="90:e2:ba:36:99:3c")/IP(src="192.168.0.5", dst="192.168.0.4")], iface="eth3")

Test Case:  test_reta
=====================

This case test hash reta table, the test steps same with test_rss_hash except config hash reta table

Before send packet, config hash reta,512(niantic nic have 128 reta) reta entries configuration::

  testpmd command: port config 0 rss reta (hash_index,queue_id)
