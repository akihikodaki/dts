======================================================
Benchmark the performance of VF single core forwarding
======================================================

Prerequisites
=============

1.  Nic single core performance test requirements:

    1.1) FVL25G: two dual port FVL25G nics, all installed on the same socket,
                 pick one port per nic.
    1.2) NNT10G: four 82599 nics, all installed on the same socket,
                 pick one port per nic.
    1.3) CVL100G: one CVL100G nics, all installed on the same socket,
                 pick one port per nic.

2. Software::

    dpdk: git clone http://dpdk.org/git/dpdk
    scapy: http://www.secdev.org/projects/scapy/
    dts (next branch): git clone http://dpdk.org/git/tools/dts, 
                       then "git checkout next" 
    Trex code: http://trex-tgn.cisco.com/trex/release/v2.84.tar.gz 
               (to be run in stateless Layer 2 mode, see section in
                Getting Started Guide for more details)
    python-prettytable:
        apt install python-prettytable (for ubuntu os) 
        or dnf install python-prettytable (for fedora os). 

3. Connect all the selected nic ports to traffic generator(IXIA,TREX,
   PKTGEN) ports(TG ports)::

    2 TG 25g  ports for FVL25G ports
    4 TG 10g  ports for 4 NNT10G ports
    1 TG 100g ports for CVL100G port

Test Case : Vf Single Core Performance Measurement
==================================================

1. Bind PF ports to kernel driver, i40e/ixgbe/ice, then create 1 VF from each PF,
   take XXV710 for example::

    echo 1 > /sys/bus/pci/devices/0000\:af\:00.0/sriov_numvfs
    echo 1 > /sys/bus/pci/devices/0000\:b1\:00.1/sriov_numvfs

2. Set vf mac address::

    ip link set ens5f0 vf 0 mac 00:12:34:56:78:01
    ip link set ens6f0 vf 0 mac 00:12:34:56:78:02

3. Bind all the created VFs to dpdk driver, vfio-pci or igb_uio::

    ./usertools/dpdk-devbind.py -b vfio-pci af:02.0 b1:02.0

4. Start testpmd::

    ./<build_target>/app/dpdk-testpmd -l 28,29 -n 4 -- -i --portmask=0x3  --txd=512 --rxd=512 \
    --txq=2 --rxq=2 --nb-cores=1

    testpmd> set fwd mac
    testpmd> start

5. Configure traffic generator to send traffic::

    dst mac: peer nic port mac
    src ip : random
    dst ip : fixed
    frame size: 64 byte
    transmit rate: 100%

6. Result tables.

   +-----------+------------+---------+-------------+---------+---------------------+
   |  Fwd_core | Frame Size | TXD/RXD |  Throughput |   Rate  | Expected Throughput |
   +===========+============+=========+=============+=========+=====================+
   |  1C/1T    |    64      |   512   |  xxxxx Mpps |   xxx % |  xxxxxxx   Mpps     |
   +-----------+------------+---------+-------------+---------+---------------------+
   |  1C/1T    |    64      |   2048  |  xxxxx Mpps |   xxx % |  xxxxxxx   Mpps     |
   +-----------+------------+---------+-------------+---------+---------------------+
   |  1C/2T    |    64      |   512   |  xxxxx Mpps |   xxx % |  xxxxxxx   Mpps     |
   +-----------+------------+---------+-------------+---------+---------------------+
   |  1C/2T    |    64      |   2048  |  xxxxx Mpps |   xxx % |  xxxxxxx   Mpps     |
   +-----------+------------+---------+-------------+---------+---------------------+

  Check throughput and compare it with the expected value. Case will raise failure 
  if actual throughputs have more than 1Mpps gap from expected ones.

Note : 
   The values for the expected throughput may vary due to different platform and OS, 
   and traffic generator, please correct threshold values accordingly.
