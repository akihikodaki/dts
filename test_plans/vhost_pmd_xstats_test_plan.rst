Vhost PMD Xstats Tests
======================

This test plan will cover the basic vhost pmd xstats case and will be worked
as a regression test plan. In the test plan, we will use vhost as a pmd port
in testpmd.

Test Case1: xstats based on packet size
=======================================

Flow::

  TG-->NIC-->>Vhost TX-->Virtio RX-->Virtio TX-->Vhost RX-->NIC-->TG

1. Bind one physical port to igb_uio, then launch the testpmd

2. Launch VM1 with using hugepage, 2048M memory, 2 cores,
   1 sockets, 1 virtio-net-pci::

     taskset -c 6-7 qemu-system-x86_64 -name us-vhost-vm1 -cpu host -enable-kvm
     -m 2048 -object memory-backend-file,id=mem,size=2048M,mem-path=/mnt/huge,
     share=on -numa node,memdev=mem -mem-prealloc -smp cores=2,sockets=1 -drive
     file=/home/osimg/ubuntu16.img -chardev socket,id=char0,path=./vhost-net
     -netdev type=vhost-user,id=mynet1,chardev=char0,vhostforce,queues=1
     -device virtio-net-pci,mac=52:54:00:00:00:01,netdev=mynet1,mrg_rxbuf=off,mq=on
     -netdev tap,id=ipvm1,ifname=tap3,script=/etc/qemu-ifup -device rtl8139,
     netdev=ipvm1,id=net0,mac=00:00:00:00:10:01 -localtime -vnc :10 -daemonize

3. On VM1, run testpmd

4. On host, testpmd, set ports to the mac forward mode::

     testpmd>set fwd mac
     testpmd>start tx_first

5. On VM, testpmd, set port to the mac forward mode::

     testpmd>set fwd mac
     testpmd>start

6. On host run "show port xstats all" at least twice to check the packets number

7. Let TG generate different size of packets, send 10000 packets for each packet
   sizes(64,128,255, 512, 1024, 1523), check the statistic number is correct

8. On host run "clear port xstats all" , then all the statistic date should be 0

Test Case2: xstats based on packet types
========================================

Similar as Test Case1, all steps are similar except step 6, 7:

6. On host run "show port xstats all" at least twice to check the packets type:

7. Let TG generate different type of packets, broadcast, multicast, ucast, check
   the statistic number is correct

8. On host run "clear port xstats all" , then all the statistic date should be 0

Test Case3: stability case with multiple queues
===============================================

1. No need bind any physical port to igb_uio,then launch the testpmd

2. Launch VM1, set queues=2, vectors=2xqueues+2, mq=on, with using hugepage,
   2048M memory, 2 cores, 1 sockets, 1 virtio-net-pci::

     taskset -c 6-7 qemu-system-x86_64 -name us-vhost-vm1 -cpu host -enable-kvm
     -m 2048 -object memory-backend-file,id=mem,size=2048M,mem-path=/mnt/huge,\
     share=on -numa node,memdev=mem -mem-prealloc \
     -smp cores=2,sockets=1 -drive file=/home/osimg/ubuntu16.img  \
     -chardev socket,id=char0,path=./vhost-net \
     -netdev type=vhost-user,id=mynet1,chardev=char0,vhostforce,queues=1 \
     -device virtio-net-pci,mac=52:54:00:00:00:01,netdev=mynet1,mrg_rxbuf=off,mq=on \
     -netdev tap,id=ipvm1,ifname=tap3,script=/etc/qemu-ifup -device rtl8139,
     netdev=ipvm1,id=net0,mac=00:00:00:00:10:01 -localtime -vnc :10 -daemonize

3. On VM1, run testpmd

4. On host, testpmd, set ports to the mac forward mode::

     testpmd>set fwd io retry
     testpmd>start tx_first 8

5. On VM, testpmd, set port to the mac forward mode::

     testpmd>start

6. Send packets for 30 minutes, check the Xstats still can work correctly::

     testpmd>show port xstats all
