VM Power Management Tests
=========================

This test plan is for the test and validation of feature VM Power Management
of DPDK 1.8.

VM Power Manager would use a hint based mechanism by which a VM can
communicate to a host based governor about its current processing
requirements. By mapping VMs virtual CPUs to physical CPUs the Power Manager
can then make decisions according to some policy as to what power state the
physical CPUs can transition to.

VM Agent shall have the ability to send the following hints to host:
- Scale frequency down
- Scale frequency up
- Reduce frequency to min
- Increase frequency to max

The Power manager is responsible for enabling the Linux userspace power
governor and interacting via its sysfs entries to get/set frequencies.

The power manager will manage the file handles for each core(<n>) below:

- ``/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu<n>/cpufreq/scaling_governor``
- ``/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu<n>/cpufreq/scaling_available_frequencies``
- ``/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu<n>/cpufreq/scaling_cur_freq``
- ``/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu<n>/cpufreq/scaling_setspeed``

    Create temporary folder for vm_power socket.

        mkdir /tmp/powermonitor

    Setup one serial port for every one vcpu in VM.

    .. code-block:: xml

        <channel type='unix'>
        <source mode='bind' path='/tmp/powermonitor/<vm_name>.<channel_num>'/>
        <target type='virtio' name='virtio.serial.port.poweragent.<channel_num>'/>
        <address type='virtio-serial' controller='0' bus='0' port='4'/>
        </channel>

        vmpower> add_vm <vm_name>
        vmpower> add_channels <vm_name> all
        vmpower> show_cpu_freq <core_num>

        vmpower> show_vm <vm_name>
        VM:
        vCPU Refresh: 1
        Channels 5
          [0]: /tmp/powermonitor/<vm_name>.0, status = 1
          [1]: /tmp/powermonitor/<vm_name>.1, status = 1
          [2]: /tmp/powermonitor/<vm_name>.2, status = 1
          [3]: /tmp/powermonitor/<vm_name>.3, status = 1
          [4]: /tmp/powermonitor/<vm_name>.4, status = 1
        Virtual CPU(s): 5
          [0]: Physical CPU Mask 0x2
          [1]: Physical CPU Mask 0x4
          [2]: Physical CPU Mask 0x8
          [3]: Physical CPU Mask 0x10
          [4]: Physical CPU Mask 0x20
