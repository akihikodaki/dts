Sample Application Tests: Vxlan Example
=======================================

Vxlan sample simulates a VXLAN Tunnel Endpoint (VTEP) termination in DPDK.
It is used to demonstrate the offload and filtering capabilities of i40 NIC
for VXLAN packet.

Vxlan sample uses the basic virtio devices management function from vHOST
example, and the US-vHost interface and tunnel filtering mechanism to direct
the traffic to/from a specific VM.

Vxlan sample is also designed to show how tunneling protocols can be handled.

Prerequisites
=============
1x Intel® X710 (Fortville) NICs (2x 40GbE full duplex optical ports per NIC)
plugged into the available PCIe Gen3 8-lane slot.

2x Intel® XL710-DA4 (Eagle Fountain) (1x 10GbE full duplex optical ports per NIC)
plugged into the available PCIe Gen3 8-lane slot.

DUT board must be two sockets system and each cpu have more than 8 lcores.

Update qemu-system-x86_64 to version 2.2.0 which support hugepage based memory.

    testpmd> set fwd mac
    testpmd> start tx_first
