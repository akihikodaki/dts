# DPDK ABI Stable Tests
# =====================
#
# Description
# ===========
#
# This test suite includes both functional and performance test cases to
# ensure that DPDK point releases (xx.02, xx.05, xx.08) are not only binary
# compatible, but are also functionally and reasonably performance
# compatibly with the previous vxx.11 release.
